As <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/MediaCenterUpdateRollup2.aspx">Omar</a> recently pointed out, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;900325&amp;sd=rss&amp;spid=7024">Update Rollup 2 for Windows XP Media Center 2005</a> adds one essential new feature that makes it a "must have" upgrade -- <b>non-linear stretch!</b> I took a few screenshots on <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000221.html">my HTPC</a> to illustrate.
</p>
<p>
This is <b>typical 4:3 television content</b>:

</p>
<p>
On a widescreen 16:9 display, the content just doesn't fit-- at least not at the original aspect ratio. You get black bars on the side. So what can we do about this? You could <b>zoom in</b>:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Look how much content we've cropped away around the edges! Let's try a simple <b>stretch to fit</b> instead:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="stretch mode in MCE 2005" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d643f970b" height="360" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2005/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d643f970b-pi.jpg" width="636">
</p>
<p>
No content is lost, but we've distorted everything: it's wider and fatter.
</p>
<p>
Clearly zooming and stretching both have their drawbacks. Non-linear zoom, on the other hand, is a happy combination of both: <b>the image is slightly cropped on the top and bottom, then progressively stretched more towards the edges; the center is barely stretched at all:</b>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Microsoft calls this <b>Intelligent Zoom</b>, and it has far fewer downsides than a pure zoom or stretch. It's my new favorite viewing mode for 4:3 content!
</p>
<p>
This new viewing mode isn't just cosmetic. It can be essential to preserving your plasma or LCD television investment! <b>After 8 months, our plasma TV had noticeable burn-in on the edges where the "black bars" appear for the 4:3 content!</b> I immediately switched the bars to 100% white until the wear levels equalized, and now I have the bars permanently set to 50% grey.
</p>
<p>
However, this new non-linear stretch mode is an even better option. Highly recommended.
