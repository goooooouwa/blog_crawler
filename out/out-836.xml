In a world of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">43Folders</a>* and dozens of other blogs that worship at the altar of <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done/">Getting Things Done</a>, it's a little surprising that nobody has taken aim at the #1 enemy of productivity everywhere: <b>The Internet</b>.
</p>
<p>
Do you spend so much time obsessively keeping up with the latest ninja tips on productivity, programming, and time management that you <i>run out of time to actually Get Things Done?</i>
</p>
<p>
If so, you're not alone.
</p>
<p>
I have a <i>wee problem</i> with procrastination. The internet, and chain upon chain of fascinating links, is never more than a keystroke away. It's a problem.

<p>
Sometimes I truly think I'd be more productive if I <b>disconnected my ethernet jack.</b>
</p>
<p>
All things in moderation, I suppose, but it's hard to sip from a firehose of information.
