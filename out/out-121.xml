In November, I delivered the keynote presentation at <a href="http://oredev.org">Øredev</a> 2011. It was the second and probably final presentation in the series I call <b>Building Social Software for the Anti-Social</b>.
</p>
<p>
I've spent almost four years thinking about the Q&amp;A format, and these two presentations are the culmination of that line of thought. In them I present ten "scary ideas", ideas which are <i>counterintuitive</i> for most folks. These are the building blocks we used to construct Stack Overflow, and by extension, Server Fault, Super User, and the rest of the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">Stack Exchange network</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Radically lower the bar for participation.
</li>
<li>Trusting (some of) your users.
</li>
<li>Life is the world’s biggest MMORPG.
</li>
<li>Bad stuff happens.
</li>
<li>Love trumps money.
</li>
<li>Rules can be fun and social.
</li>
<li>All modern website design is game design.
</li>
<li>Thoughtful game design creates sustainable communities.
</li>
<li>The community isn’t always right.
</li>
<li>Some moderation required.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It's not the same experience as attending the actual live presentation, of course, but you can certainly get the gist of it by viewing the slides for these two presentations online:

The Øredev organizers hired <a href="http://www.imagethink.net/">ImageThink</a> to draw each presentation on a whiteboard live on stage as it was presented. I was skeptical that this would work, but the whiteboard visualizations came out great for all the presentations. Here's the two whiteboard drawings ImageThink created during my presentation. (Yes, they had <i>two</i> artists on stage "live whiteboarding", one on the left side, and one on the right side.)

It's not a bad approximation of what was covered. If you're curious about live whiteboard visualizations, ImageThink posted <a href="http://www.blog.imagethink.net/line-by-line/2011/12/15/the-power-of-visuals-in-the-virtual-world-imagethink-webinar.html">a great set of links on their blog</a> that I highly recommend.

<p>
After four years, we've mostly figured out what works and what doesn't work for our particular brand of low noise, high signal Q&amp;A at Stack Exchange. But the title <b>Social Software for the Anti-Social</b> is only partially tongue in cheek. If you want to <i>learn</i> anything online, you have to design your software to refocus and redirect people's natural social group impulses, and that's what these presentations attempt to explain. I hope you enjoy them!
