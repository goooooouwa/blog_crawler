God bless whoever at Microsoft decided to build <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=32b0d059-b53a-4dc9-8265-da47f157c091&amp;displaylang=en">Calculator Plus</a>, an unsupported free upgrade for calc.exe. On the other hand.. who decided it was a good idea to skin the UI by default?

Perhaps boring, but far more usable. I know skinning is a matter of opinion to some degree, but-- come on. At least have a professional graphic designer put together a skin if you're going to traumatize the user with a non-standard UI. And even then, I doubt you should be doing it. You better have a damn good reason to deviate from the standard OS look and feel that users expect. For comparison, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.asp&amp;e=7620">Windows Media Center</a> does have a good reason to implement a radically different UI --  it's designed to be used from the couch with a remote.
