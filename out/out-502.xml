I was struck, the other day, by <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000377.html">how much I had to <i>think</i></a> when attempting to heat up my sandwich in the microwave. There are so many controls: a clock, a set of food-specific buttons, defrost and timer controls, and of course a full numeric keypad. Quick! What do you press?

I wonder if older microwaves weren't <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000726.html">a better, simpler design</a>, with their single giant analog knob. I noticed that <a href="http://www.target.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_0_1038580_15/602-6641377-6679015?ie=UTF8&amp;node=1041762">every microwave for sale at Target</a>, even the most inexpensive ones, now use a complete set of digital controls.
</p>
<p>
This is progress?
</p>
<p>
Maybe something to think about, the next time you're about to add <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000548.html">just one more field</a>, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000920.html">button</a>, or <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000985.html">link</a> to that form.
