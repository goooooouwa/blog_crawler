Remember when anything you could possibly imagine could be controlled with <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/cubegoodies/toys/5d39/">a single stick and a single button</a>? Trace the evolution of human interaction in video gaming from 1980 to the present through this <a href="http://www.axess.com/twilight/console/index.html">remarkable visual game controller family tree</a>.

This tree isn't quite as complete as I would like (where is the Odyssey2, for example), but it's got the major players. I had half forgotten how weird the controllers with keypads were, and that the Atari Jaguar was the last console to adopt this oddball convention. Input conventions have certainly changed a lot over the last 20 years; the most profound change-- single digital axis to dual analog axes-- was prompted by the broad switch from 2D to 3D games around 1997.

If you're feeling particularly retro, you can pick up a modern USB incarnation of the no-frills Atari 2600 joystick that started it all for <a href="http://www.redoctane.com/atarigamejoystick.html">a mere five bucks</a>.
