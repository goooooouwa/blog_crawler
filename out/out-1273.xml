If <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000050.html">Task Manager Extension</a> is Task Manager on steroids, then Mark Russinovich's <a href="http://www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/procexp.shtml">Process Explorer</a> is Task Manager in a ripped anabolic fury, fueled by high octane rage. In other words, <b>it's extreme</b>:

</p>
<p>
Although it can be a little overwhelming-- I think it just kicked sand in my face-- it does have some features that I prefer over Task Manager Extension, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A menu item to enable/disable replacing Task Manager
</li>
<li>Drag and drop spy icon button to visually identify windows and their corresponding processes
</li>
<li>Real-time, color-coded highlighting of changes
</li>
<li>Native support of .NET processes
</li>
<li>Shows TCP/IP connections for a given process
</li>
<li>Lists all strings found in a given process
</li>
</ul>
<p>
.. among many, many other things. And of course it duplicates all the functionality of Task Manager Extension. If you've outgrown Task Manager completely, this is definitely the tool for you.
