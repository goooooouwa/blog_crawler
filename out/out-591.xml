<title>Let's Build a Grid</title>

Khoi Vinh, the design director for the New York Times, <b>explains how essential grids are to web design</b> in his SXSW presentation with Mark Boulton, <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/0318_oh_yeeaahh.php">Grids Are Good (Right?)</a>.
</p>
<p>
So much web design work relies on establishing a grid and the constraints on that grid: ad sizes, display size, browser display area minus chrome, and so forth. Grids are, quite literally, everywhere. But learning how to effectively utilize grids-- without becoming a slave to them-- can make the difference between a competent layout and a great layout.
</p>
<p>
The case study in <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf">the presentation</a> (pdf) is Yahoo!, which offers <i>"rudimentary but unimaginative use of grid"</i>. The redesign, Yeeaahh!, offers a more flexible and interesting grid alignment that feels less like a &lt;table&gt; tag writ large.

</table>
<p>
The point wasn't to improve on Yahoo's design. The idea was to <b>use the redesign to illustrate the various methods and principles that experienced designers use in grid layouts</b>. Can you see the grid at work on this redesigned page?

</p>
<p>
How about now?
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Yahoo! personals, redesigned with grid overlaid" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d8acf970b" height="344" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/05/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d8acf970b-pi.png" width="435">

Learning to <i>see</i> the grids is the first step. The presentation slides are quite instructive; you can <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf">download the slides</a> (8mb pdf) directly from Khoi's site.

The grid pictured above is an advanced scenario, created by and for expert designers. But <a href="http://intensivstation.ch/en/templates/">basic CSS grid layouts</a> are a fairly <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000474.html">well understood science by now</a>. They offer a cookbook of layouts for neophyte designers to choose from.

<p>
When you're not sure where to begin with your UI design, <b>start by building a grid</b>. But grids don't have to be a straitjacket. Approached with the proper mindset, they can be liberating. Embracing the constraints of a grid in your design-- and knowing when to break those constraints-- is a crucial skill for designers, both neophyte and expert.
