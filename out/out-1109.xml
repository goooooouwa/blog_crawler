Wil Shipley, the entity behind <a href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/apps/delicious-library.ars">Delicious Library</a>, has a hilarious (and informative) talk on why he develops software for the Mac-- and also netted $54,000 from Delicious Library on the first day with zero advertising.

One of the funniest and most oddly inspiring things I've read in a long time. Highly recommended.
