It's always reassuring to be reminded that people much more talented than myself make mistakes, too. And I especially appreciate it when they share those mistakes in the form of advice:
</p>
<p>
On avoiding IT mistakes: Rick Cattell's <a href="http://www.cattell.net/talk/TiwiliesTalk.htm">Things I Wish I Learned in Engineering School</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
<ul>
<li>Good technology is only 10% of "real world" success
</li>
<li>It's frustrating to spend years of your career building things that aren't used
</li>
<li>Maybe you can avoid some of my mistakes
</li>
</ul></i></blockquote>
<p>
On avoiding creative mistakes: Hugh Macleod's <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/000876.html">How to Be Creative</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote><i>
<ol>
<li>Ignore everybody.
</li>
<li>The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to change the world.
</li>
<li>Put the hours in.
</li>
<li>If your biz plan depends on you suddenly being "discovered" by some big shot, your plan will probably fail.
</li>
<li>You are responsible for your own experience.
</li>
</ol></i></blockquote>
