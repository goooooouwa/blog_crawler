Here's some excellent, concise advice on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2005/05/25/421926.aspx">troubleshooting performance in managed code</a>. It all starts with peanut butter, naturally:

My <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2005/05/23/421205.aspx">last entry</a> was some generic advice about how to do a good performance investigation.  I think actually it's too generic to be really useful -- in fact I think it fails my Peanut Butter Sandwich Test. I review a lot of documents and sometimes they say things that are so obvious as to be uninteresting.  The little quip I have for this situation is, "Yes what you are saying is true of [the system] but it's also true of peanut butter sandwiches." <b>Consider a snippet like this one, "Use a cache where it provides benefits," and compare with, "Use a peanut butter sandwich where it provides benefits."</b>  Both seem to work... that's a bad sign.

As promised, Rico then provides a prescriptive list of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2005/05/25/421926.aspx">windows performance monitor counters</a> with comments indicating what the values should look like in a healthy app. He also linked to another blog post with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/maoni/archive/2004/06/03/148029.aspx">a bit more detail specific to .NET memory performance counters</a> which is also worth reading through.
