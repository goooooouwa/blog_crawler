I've become rather agnostic on the whole topic of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000128.html">C# versus VB.NET</a>, but there are still those annoying little differences that sneak up behind you and rabbit-punch you in the kidneys. Like, say, using the VS.NET 2003 <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c3a0kd3x.aspx">command window in immediate mode</a> to print a string:

</p>
<p>
Usually VB.NET is guilty of handling things in odd and unexpected ways, but this time it's C#. <b>I expect newlines to appear in the immediate window as, oh, I don't know.. NEW LINES?</b> It's a bit difficult to read text filled with a bunch of rn notation instead of human readable whitespace. What's worse is that <i>even the variable tooltips in C# behave this way!</i>
</p>
<p>
How can I work around this annoying "feature" of the C# IDE? I thought about creating a macro to use <code>?System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(s)</code>, which behaves appropriately, but the Diagnostics class isn't always in scope at a breakpoint.
