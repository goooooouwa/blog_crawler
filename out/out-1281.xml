Back in June, I mentioned that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000024.html">my favorite visual differencing tool was Araxis Merge</a>. A co-worker recently recommended that I try out <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/home.php">Beyond Compare</a>, so I downloaded the 30-day trial and spent an hour playing with it. It's definitely comparable to Araxis Merge. And in a lot of ways, it's better. But the real kicker is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
Araxis Merge single <a href="http://www.araxis.com/merge/purchasing.html">license</a>: <b>$129</b>. 5 or more, <b>$83</b> each
<p>
Beyond Compare single <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/shop.php">license</a>: <b>$30</b>. 5 or more, <b>$17</b> each
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Fatality.
</p>
<p>
It's better than Araxis Merge and it's one-third the price! Beyond Compare is the kind of finely crafted software that inspires you to register it. Give the <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/beycomp.exe">30-day trial version</a> a shot and I bet you'll feel the same way.
</p>
<p>
BC not only matches Merge in terms of visual differencing features, but <b>it also doubles as a kick ass project deployment tool</b>. I like <a href="http://www.eworldui.net/unleashit/">Unleashit</a>, but sometimes you get what you pay for.
</p>
<p>
Because of the deep multiple license discount, we decided to buy five licenses for work. That's still $44 less than one copy of Araxis Merge! If you also decide to register BC, don't forget to download the <a href="http://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php?c=v2plugins">filetype specific comparison plugins</a>, too.
