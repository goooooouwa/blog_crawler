<p>I woke up a few days ago and realized I was still carrying <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/08/whats-on-your-utility-belt.html">the same 32 GB USB flash drive</a> on my keychain that I purchased in 2010. I thought to myself, this is an unacceptable state of affairs. Totally. Unacceptable.</p>
<p>It's been few years since I seriously looked at USB drive performance. Premium USB flash drives typically eke out <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/large-usb-flash-drive-performance.html">about 10-20 MB per second</a>, strongly favoring reads, but I've recently purchased a number of inexpensive 4 GB USB drives that barely got to 4 MB per second. That's OK, since they were only intended as cheap <s><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2005/02/the-floppy-drive-must-die.html">floppy drive</a></s> CD and DVD replacements. Based on that experience, I wasn't expecting much improvement in the status quo.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 is finally becoming somewhat prevalent on PCs and Macs, so I figured I'd:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch to a current-generation USB 3.0 flash drive.</li>
<li>Bump up to 64 GB storage this generation, one step over the 32 GB model I currently carry.</li>
<li>Optimistically hope against hope that they've gotten fast enough by now to get anywhere near USB 2.0 throughput limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>I checked around and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNLGXE0/?tag=codihorr-20">Patriot Supersonic</a> series gets good reviews. The price seemed about right at $75 for a 64 GB device. So I bought one. I plugged it in to one of the USB 3.0 ports on my PC and …</p>

<p>Holy. Crap.</p>
<p>But wait! That was way back in Ye Olde 2012! I upgraded to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNLGXE0/?tag=codihorr-20"><b>128 GB</b> Supersonic Rage 2</a> today and …</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/08/rage-2-reads.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/08/rage-2-writes.png" alt=""></p>
<p><b>365 MB/s reads and 254 MB/s writes?</b> <i>Yes please!</i></p>
<p>Needless to say, this thing handily saturates a USB 2.0 connection at around 27 - 30 MB/sec — but plug it into one of those blue USB 3.0 ports on newer Macs or PCs and prepare to feel like <a href="http://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2010/05/31/blown-away-man/">the "blown away" guy in the Maxell ad</a>.</p>
<p>I haven't run a <a href="http://www.storagereview.com/patriot_supersonic_rage_2_usb_flash_drive_review">full set of benchmarks</a> on this guy, but the only downside I've noticed so far is that it is a bit chunkier in width than my previous USB flash drive. It might be a bit more to carry, and might not fit some USB ports depending on what's adjacent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SNLGXE0/?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/08/StorageReview-Patriot-Supersonic-Rage-2-USB-Flash.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Even in the mere 3 years from 2012 to 2015, for the very same $75 we have</p>
<ul>
<li>doubled capacity (128 GB vs 64 GB)</li>
<li>1.5 × read speed</li>
<li>1.7 × write speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I feel like a total dork for continuing to carry around a 2010 era flash drive that I <i>thought</i> had decent performance at 20 MB/sec. Forget that noise. Now we can <b>darn near carry pocket solid state hard drives on our keychains!</b> Nobody told me, man!</p>
<p>So now I'm telling you. Enjoy.</p>
