<title>Wintellect ASP.NET FAQ</title>

Nothing beats a well constructed FAQ based on lots of real-world questions. It's a little old, but I was surprised how much genuinely insightful material is present in the <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/resources/faqs/default.aspx?faq_id=1">Wintellect ASP.NET FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's a mixture of the mundane <i>(How do I comment out statements in ASPX files? )</i> and the sublime <i>(If I update session state, should I lock it, too? Are concurrent accesses by multiple requests executing on multiple threads a concern with session state?)</i>. At any rate, guaranteed to contain a few things you didn't know you needed to know about ASP.NET.
