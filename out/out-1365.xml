<blockquote>
The silicon chip inside her head<br>
Gets switched to overload.<br>
And nobody's gonna go to school today,<br>
She's going to make them stay at home.<br>
And daddy doesn't understand it,<br>
He always said she was as good as gold.<br>
And he can see no reason<br>
'Cause there are no reasons<br>
What reason do you need to be shown?<br>
<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
I want to shoot<br>
The whole day down.<br>
<br>
The telex machine is kept so clean<br>
As it types to a waiting world.<br>
And mother feels so shocked,<br>
Father's world is rocked,<br>
And their thoughts turn to<br>
Their own little girl.<br>
Sweet 16 ain't so peachy keen,<br>
No, it ain't so neat to admit defeat.<br>
They can see no reasons<br>
'Cause there are no reasons<br>
What reason do you need to be shown?<br>
<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
I want to shoot<br>
The whole day down.<br>
<br>
All the playing's stopped in the playground now<br>
She wants to play with her toys a while.<br>
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning<br>
And the lesson today is how to die.<br>
And then the bullhorn crackles,<br>
And the captain crackles,<br>
With the problems and the how's and why's.<br>
And he can see no reasons<br>
'Cause there are no reasons<br>
What reason do you need to die?<br>
<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
Tell me why?<br>
I don't like Mondays.<br>
I want to shoot<br>
The whole day down.<br>
<br>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Spencer">Brenda Spencer</a>: "I just started shooting, that's it. I just did it for the fun of it. I just don't like Mondays....I just did it because it's a way to cheer the day up.
<b>Nobody likes Mondays</b>."  There's <a href="http://www.cyberspace7.btinternet.co.uk/idlm.htm">no parole for the sniper who hated Mondays</a>, and <a href="http://www.thesandiegochannel.com/news/528926/detail.html">survivors still remember the 1979 Cleveland Elementary shooting</a>.
