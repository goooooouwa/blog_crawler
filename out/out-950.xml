                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>
Here at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000502.html">VSLive! 2006 San Francisco</a>, I've been sitting through a lot of presentations. Unfortunately, I've spent a disproportionate amount of that time staring at <b>tiny, unreadable 12 and 10 point IDE text</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Presenters, please don't do this to your audiences</b>. If you can't pre-scale the font appropriately in the application, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/01/22/scottHanselmansTipsForASuccessfulMsftPresentation.html">make use of one of the many automatic magnification utilities out there</a>.
</p>
<p>
Heck, you can even use Windows XP's built in magnifier utility: <b>Start, Run, Magnify</b>.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The options for magnify.exe are limited but entirely servicable:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>It can automatically follow:
<ul>
<li>the mouse cursor
</li>
<li>the keyboard focus
</li>
<li>text editing
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>Click and drag the magnification surface to move it. It can float as a window or it can dock to any side of the screen like the taskbar.
</li>
<li>Drag the corners to resize the surface. </li>
<li>The magnification is adjustable from 1x to 9x.
</li>
<p>
In the screenshot above, I have the magnification window docked to the top of the screen. The IDE is maximized normally under it. Since magnify follows all my mouse and keyboard actions automatically, <b>everything I do is now perfectly visible -- even from the last row of the room</b>.
</p>
