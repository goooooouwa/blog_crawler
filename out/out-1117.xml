                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>You may be familiar with the font <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/web/fonts/comicsns/default.htm">Comic Sans MS</a>:</p>
<p>

<p>Over the last 5 years, my wife and I noticed that this annoying font is inordinately popular "in the wild" -- we've seen it in the strangest places. Enough so that it has become a running joke whenever we see it.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fb284970c" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2005/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fb284970c-pi.jpg" border="0" alt="comic_sans_luftballongas.jpg" width="360" height="360"></p>
<p>We may be weird, but we're not alone: there's a <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/home.html">Ban Comic Sans</a> website.</p>
<blockquote>Like the tone of a spoken voice, the characteristics of a typeface convey meaning. The design of the typeface is, in itself, its voice. Often this voice speaks louder than the text itself. Thus when designing a "Do Not Enter" sign the use of a heavy-stroked, attention-commanding font such as Impact or Arial Black is appropriate. Typesetting such a message in Comic Sans would be ludicrous. Though this is sort of misuse is frequent, it is unjustified. Clearly, Comic Sans as a voice conveys silliness, childish naivete, irreverence, and is far too casual for such a purpose. <strong>It is analogous to showing up for a black tie event in a clown costume.</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a rather amusing <a href="http://www.connare.com/comic.htm">history of comic sans</a> presentation which I recommend-- now we know to blame Vincent Connare for this font. Vincent does his best to <a href="http://www.connare.com/comic.htm">defend the font</a> on his website:</p>
<blockquote>Comic Sans was designed because when I was working at Microsoft I received a beta version of Microsoft Bob. It was a comic software package that had a dog called Rover at the beginning and he had a balloon with messages using Times New Roman.
<p>Comic Sans was NOT designed as a typeface but as a solution to a problem with the often overlooked part of a computer program's interface, the typeface used to communicate the message [in a comic character's message balloon].</p>
<p><strong>There was no intention to include the font in other applications other than those designed for children when I designed Comic Sans.</strong> The inspiration came at the shock of seeing Times New Roman used in an inappropriate way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proving, yet again, that anything which came from <a href="http://www.telecommander.com/pics/links/application%20software/microsoft/Microsoft_Bob_1_0/Microsoft_Bob_1_0.htm">Microsoft Bob</a> cannot be good. The misappropriation of Comic Sans is truly epidemic. At this point, we're bracing for the inevitable <strong>Comic Serif</strong>.</p>
