Today's post is a simple question.
</p>
<p>
Let's say, hypothetically speaking, you met someone who told you they had two children, and one of them is a girl. <b>What are the odds that person has a boy <i>and</i> a girl?</b>
</p>
<p>

Consider your answer carefully, <i>without</i> doing a web search, or reading the comments to this post. Don't cheat -- but be prepared to explain your reasoning, because the solution might surprise you.
