A few years ago, I did a bit of research on computer desks and decided on <a href="http://www.anthro.com/ppage.aspx?pmid=18">this AnthroCart model</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="The Anthrocart Console Unit Desk" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fd4ca970c" height="300" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/03/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fd4ca970c-pi.jpg" width="300">
</p>
<p>
And it's a fantastic computer desk. But its Wife Acceptance Factor (<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2004/06/28/waf_wife_acceptance_factor/">WAF</a>) is abysmal for a few reasons:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>It's absolutely enormous
</li>
<li>It's black
</li>
<li>Its design is better suited to an office than a home
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Plus, we just bought a small home in the Bay Area*, and we need to optimize for space. Looks like I'll be selling the Anthrocart.
</p>
<p>
Which means I'm looking for a smaller desk now.
</p>
<p>
I had to buy an additional desk when I moved to California, prior to all our stuff arriving. Since we have easy access to IKEA, I went with the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10101&amp;storeId=12&amp;productId=47022&amp;langId=-1&amp;parentCats=10121*10389">IKEA Jerker desk</a>.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="IKEA Jerker Desk" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fd4cf970c" height="273" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/03/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fd4cf970c-pi.jpg" width="260">
</p>
<p>
You can see the edge of the Jerker in the bottom-most photo of <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/23/2432.aspx">Phil's dog Twiggy</a>. There's something about the Jerker that inspires people: <a href="http://adam.pra.to/content/jerker/">Behold! The shrine to the IKEA Jerker desk!</a>
</p>
<p>
Although I really do like the Jerker-- and the name alone is worth the 99 bucks-- I'm still researching my options. <b>What is your favorite computer desk, and why?</b>
</p>
