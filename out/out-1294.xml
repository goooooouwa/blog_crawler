I posted a new CodeProject article, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/WebFileManager.asp">Web File Manager</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><i>
I often deploy ASP.NET websites to servers that I don't control. In these situations, I can't get to the underlying filesystem to do any file maintenance, because I don't have direct access to the server. For various reasons, I often need to access the filesystem indirectly, through the website that I am deploying. Rather than writing a bunch of special purpose pages to deal with file management, I developed a generic WebFileManager page than can be dropped into any ASP.NET website. This page performs the most common file and folder operations.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
Nothing earth shattering, but I find it very useful. I will respond to any feedback left on the article page.
