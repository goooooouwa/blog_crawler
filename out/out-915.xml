Which pill bottle would you rather use?

The rightmost bottle was <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/nymetro/health/features/11700/index.html">designed  by Target to address the shortcomings of traditional pill bottles</a>. And you probably decided which pill bottle you liked best within <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4616700.stm">a twentieth of a second</a>.
</p>
<p>
When I suggested <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000401.html">redesigning address input in web forms</a>, there was some resistance. Current web forms are <i>good enough</i>. Yeah, they have some shortcomings. But why change what works? Why change what people are used to?
</p>
<p>
<b>Why did we have to wait 50 years for a better pill bottle?</b> Because the shortcomings of pill bottles weren't <i>important</i> enough to justify a new design? I think that's a crock. We should constantly be striving to overcome existing shortcomings with better designs.
</p>
<p>
Donald Norman has a <a href="http://www.jnd.org/GoodDesign.html">page with examples of well-designed products</a> that he calls <b>In Praise of Good Design</b>. Did the kitchen whisk <i>need</i> to be redesigned? No. Is it better <i>because</i> it was redesigned? Absolutely.
