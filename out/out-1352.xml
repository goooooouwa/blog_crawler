<title>Saving URLs to MHTML via .NET</title>

I just posted another CodeProject article, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/vb/net/MhtBuilder.asp">Convert any URL to a MHTML archive using native .NET code</a>. The title is a bit misleading; using my class, you can actually convert any URL to one of four formats in a single line of code:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Page, complete (HTML plus files in subfolder)
</li>
<li>Web Archive, single file (MHTML only)
</li>
<li>Web Page, HTML only (HTML only)
</li>
<li>Text File (TXT only)
</li>
</ul>
This mimics the <b>File | Save As menu in Internet Explorer</b> as closely as I could get it to. It's pretty darn close, and quite handy. We are using IE as a basic reporting engine, and it's a lot easier to email someone a report-- or store it in a document management system-- when you have a single MHTML file!
<p>
I knew IE had some crazy way of <b>saving a complete web page as a single file</b>, but I was as surprised as anyone else to find that IE's "Web Archive" save option is based on an actual internet standard: RFC standard 2557, <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2557.txt">compliant Multipart MIME Message (MHTML web archive)</a>. As I <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000024.html">mentioned</a> a few months ago, this <a href="http://maf.mozdev.org/">should work in Firefox</a>, too..
