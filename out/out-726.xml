I have a great deal of respect for <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/03/ipod_juggernaut">Apple's iPod juggernaut</a>. They've almost single-handedly legitimized the market for downloadable music. The kind you pay for. The kind that, at least <i>in theory</i>, supports the artists who produce the music instead of ripping them off.
</p>
<p>
That said, I have some problems with the iPod.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>The iPod is boring</b>. How can I properly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine">rage against the machine</a> with the same standard, factory issue music players that everyone else has? I don't want this to devolve into <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/">a knee-jerk rejection of all iThings</a>, but let's be honest here: when every soccer Mom carries an iPod, it's no longer a cool technical accessory. It's completely mainstream. I'd be lying if I said this didn't matter to me.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The iPod has no support for subscription services</b>. I'm a member of <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/ymu/default.asp?">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a>, which gives me unlimited access to a massive library of music for 6 bucks a month. I can stream any of this music to multiple PCs, or I can download it to my hard drive or mobile audio players. And it's in a very respectable 192kbps 2-pass CBR format, too. For that same six bucks a month, I could buy a whopping <i>six</i> tracks from the iTunes store. While I can certainly understand the desire to own music, <i>why not give us a choice?</i> Apple's insistence on purchase-only models is a huge mistake.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The iPod does not support WMA</b>. Although Jobs grudgingly made the iPod Windows compatible two years after its introduction, he still gets his jabs in. The conspicuous lack of WMA support is a not-so-subtle f*ck you to the Windows community. And what of OGG? Or FLAC? Clearly, the hardware is capable, but the political forces inside Apple won't allow it. You'd figure a company that had the guts to make a stunning, wholesale switch to x86 processors could deign to support a few alternative audio formats on their music players. But no.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The iPod lacks features.</b> I'll never understand why the iPod chooses to deliberately ignore FM radio and its rich history in the music industry. Heck, you might even want to <i>record</i> FM radio. That's just crazy talk! And the list goes on: there's no voice recording, no EQ settings, no gapless playback, etcetera.
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>The iPod requires custom software to work.</b> Every music player on the market should have this down to a science by now:
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>plug in the USB cable
</li>
<li>drag and drop your music on the device
</li>
<li>disconnect the cable and ROCK
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>
The iPod fails miserably on this count: it <i>requires</i> iTunes installed (or another <a href="http://www.redchairsoftware.com/anapod/">custom application</a>) to transfer any music to the device. You can't even use it as an external hard drive without setting up a separate, special partition on the device first. Of course, use iTunes if you want, but you shouldn't be forced to use iTunes because the hardware is a brick if you don't. How did Apple get this so very, very wrong?
</p>
</ol>
<p>
Now, your goals may not be my goals. But when my wife wanted a new music player to replace her aging <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FRio-Carbon-GB-MP3-Player%2Fdp%2FB0002UB2P0&amp;tag=codihorr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Rio Carbon</a> (RIP-- a <a href="http://dapreview.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.121">great little player for its time</a>), these are the criteria I used to evaluate them.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, music devices that can be used seamlessly and interchangeably as a generic external USB hard drive and digital music player are quite rare. The sole exception, at least for hard-disk devices, is the <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Cowon_iAudio_X5L_30GB/4505-6490_7-31383685.html">Cowon X5L</a>. The Cowon is a decent player, but it suffers from Soviet Russia-era design aesthetics. Due to lack of choices, I was forced to compromise on devices that support Microsoft's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol">Media Transfer Protocol</a>. When connected to a Windows XP or Windows Vista machine, MTP support allows you to drag and drop music directly on to the device-- <b>without installing any software</b>. It's not ideal, since it's tied to Microsoft, but it's the best I can do.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://dapreview.net/">Digital Audio Players Review</a> website had the most helpful advice. Their <a href="http://dapreview.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.259">top pick</a> was the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB000CS7UTY&amp;tag=codihorr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">
Creative Zen Vision:M</a>. I agreed, so I went with the pink one. You know, for the ladies.
</p>

</p>
<p>
It's a great little device, and as promised, we just dragged and dropped our music on it-- which happens to be a mix of MP3 and WMA files. And it worked with our <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/ymu/default.asp">Yahoo Music Unlimited</a> subscription as well.
</p>
<p>
To complement the 30gb hard drive player, I also picked up a flash device-- the new, larger <a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/prod/ultra/clix/clix-4GB.aspx">4gb iRiver Clix</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.iriveramerica.com/prod/ultra/clix/clix-4GB.aspx"><img alt="The 4gb iRiver clix" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe2e4970c" height="212" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe2e4970c-pi.jpg" width="271"></a>
</p>
<p>
I've owned a few iRiver products in the past and they've always been excellent. <a href="http://dapreview.net/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.283">dapreview gave the Clix high marks</a>, and so has <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/05/24/iriver-clix-review-roundup/">everyone else who has reviewed it</a>. The feature set is great. It meets every one of my criteria, throws in video support, and even goes a little beyond with support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Lite">Flash Lite</a> <a href="http://www.smashingcontent.com/games/iriver/">games</a>.
</p>
<p>
I respect the way the pioneering iPod has collectively led the industry out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster">dark Napster ages</a>. And I like the iPod design. But until Apple at least supports subscription services and the WMA/FLAC/OGG file formats, I can't justify purchasing any iPod hardware.
