<blockquote><i>
Lotus Notes is used by millions of people, but almost all of them seem to hate it. How can a program be so bad, yet thrive?
</i></blockquote>
<p>
We've all had bad software experiences. However, at one of my jobs, our corporate email client of choice was Lotus Notes. And <b>until you've used Lotus Notes, you haven't truly experienced bad software.</b> It is death by a thousand tiny annoyances -- the digital equivalent of being kicked in the groin upon arrival at work every day.

I won't say that Lotus Notes was the reason I quit that job, but it was definitely a factor in my decision. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000371.html">The UI is the application.</a>
</p>
<p>
Lotus Notes is a trainwreck of epic (enterprise?) proportions, but it might be worth studying to <b>learn what not to do when developing software</b>.
