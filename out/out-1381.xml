Shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/content/radiostories/2003/09/09/scottHanselmansUltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolsList.html">Scott Hanselman's most excellent Ultimate Developer Tools List</a>, <b>Task Manager Extension</b> is one of my favorite new addins.

<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000009.html">Like Notepad</a>, Task Manager is something I use on a daily basis: it's an essential part of my toolkit. I took a look at some replacements, but I'm so used to Taskman at this point, I can't retrain myself. And with <a href="http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/W-P/system/taskmanager/article.php/c5763">Task Manager Extension</a>, I don't have to; it adds all the "missing" features you could possibly want:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Shows application icons in Processes list
</li>
<li>Shows services in a different color
</li>
<li>Find files in use by any process (* shows all files in use)
</li>
<li>Find modules in use by any process (full text search)
</li>
<li>Shows process id in Applications tab
</li>
<li>Use different color for processes using lots of CPU time
</li>
<li>Query list of files, handles, modules, windows used by a given process
</li>
<li>Close a used file, or unlock an exclusively opened file for deletion
</li>
<li>Press the Delete key to kill a process or a service
</li>
</ul>
Highly recommended; I put it in the startup group so it's always loaded and can auto-attach to taskman.exe on demand. You'll know it's working when you see (extended) appended to the title of the window, and the Extension menu.
