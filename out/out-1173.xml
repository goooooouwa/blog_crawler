Due to <s>popular demand</s> one person's request, I added for sale searching to my existing <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000252.html">craigslist.org all-city search page</a>. I also made a few other minor improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching of Jobs or For Sale items
</li>
<li>Selection of subcategories
</li>
<li>Age of posts in days is shown as an offset from today
</li>
<li>Very recent and very old posts are highlighted differently
</li>
<li>If location is available, it can be mapped via Google maps
</li>
<li>Minor speed improvements
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/craigslist/">Try it out!</a> I'm open to any additional feature requests.
</p>
<p>
Except for an all-cities personals search, because that would be downright freaky. I just don't even want to know.
