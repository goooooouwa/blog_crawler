I was browsing around the <a href="http://www.couchdb.com/CouchDB/CouchDBWeb.nsf/direct/Introduction">CouchDb</a>   <a href="http://couchdb.infogami.com/">wiki</a> yesterday when I saw Damien Katz' hilarious <a href="http://couchdb.infogami.com/alpha1">description</a> of <b>how technical documentation really gets written.</b> You know, in the real world:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the world of technical documentation!</p>
<p>The situation you are in is no different from any other tech writer. The technical writing process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask engineer how the damn thing works.</li>
<li>Deafing silence.</li>
<li>Crickets.</li>
<li>Tumbleweed.</li>
<li>Just start writing something. Anything.</li>
<li>Give this something to the engineer.</li>
<li>Watch engineer become quite upset at how badly you've missed the point of everything.</li>
<li>As the engineer berates you, in between insults he will also throw off nuggets of technical information.</li>
<li>Collect these nuggets, as they are the only reliable technical information you will receive.</li>
<li>Try like hell to weave together this information into something enlightening and technically accurate.</li>
<li>Go to step 6.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok, you're not the doc writing type. That's okay, neither am I. However, people are already working to make this better, and I will continue to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think I've been on both ends of this exchange at some point in my career. It's funny because it's true. I'm sure I've read <a href="http://www.mikepope.com/blog/DisplayBlog.aspx?permalink=1114">descriptions exactly like this on Mike Pope's blog</a>.
