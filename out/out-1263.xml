When I visited <a href="http://blog.dreamprojections.com/">Alex Gorbatchev's blog</a>, I noticed he had a unique client-side code highlighting solution in place, one I hadn't seen anywhere else. That's something I've wanted on my blog for a while; the vanilla &lt;PRE&gt; sections I've been using are servicable, but primitive. Although <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000027.html">I loves me some regex</a>, I don't know squat about PERL so I've been hesitant to hack anything fancier into my Movable Type install.
</p>
<p>
After I asked Alex about his solution, he was nice enough to <a href="http://blog.dreamprojections.com/archive/2005/01/01/461.aspx">package up his JavaScript syntax highlighter as dp.SyntaxHighlighter</a>. It's really quite slick, and it works with all kinds of code: C#, VB.NET, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and XML. Here's a VB.NET sample:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre language="vb" name="code">
Public Function GetGoogleWordFrequency(ByVal strWord As String) As Integer
Dim strUrl As String = "http://www.google.com/search?num=1&amp;q=" &amp; _
Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode(strWord)
Dim wc As New WebClientGzip
Dim strPageContents As String = wc.DownloadDataGzip(strUrl)
Dim m As Match
m = Regex.Match(strPageContents, _
"results.*?d+.*?d+.*?of about.*?(?&lt;TotalResults&gt;[d,]+)", _
RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)
If Not m Is Nothing Then
Dim strResults As String = m.Groups("TotalResults").ToString
If strResults.Length &gt; 0 Then
Return Convert.ToInt32(strResults.Replace(",", ""))
End If
End If
Return -1
End Function
</pre>
<p></p>
Alex tested this JavaScript on FireFox and IE6, and is looking for compatibility feedback on other browsers.
