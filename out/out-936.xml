The archetypal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program">Hello World program</a> has always had a calming effect on developers. It's been a programming staple for decades:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
[Hello World] is typically one of the simplest programs possible in a computer language. Some, however, are surprisingly complex, especially in some GUI contexts; but most are very simple, especially those which rely heavily on a particular command line interpreter ("shell") to perform the actual output. In many embedded systems, the text may be sent to a one or two-line LCD. In yet other systems, a single LED may be turned on.
<p>
A "hello world" program can be a useful sanity test to make sure that a language's compiler, development environment, and run-time environment are correctly installed. Configuring a complete programming toolchain from scratch to the point where even trivial programs can be compiled and run may involve substantial amounts of work.
</p>
<p>
While small test programs existed since the development of programmable computers, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello world!" as the test message was influenced by <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/">the 1978 book The C Programming Language</a>. The example program from that book prints "hello, world" (no capital letters, no exclamation sign; those entered the tradition later). The book inherited the program from a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Kernighan -- <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-tutor.html">Programming in C: A Tutorial</a> -- which shows <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-tutor.html#simple-c">the first known version of the program</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wikipedia also has a <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/List_of_hello_world_programs">ridiculously comprehensive list of Hello World programs</a> in hundreds of programming languages, some of them extremely esoteric (read: joke) languages.
</p>
<p>
On the <a href="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/index.html">Great Win32 Computer Language Shootout</a> page, amongst all the various benchmark tests, there's even a <a href="http://dada.perl.it/shootout/hello.html">Hello World performance test</a> :
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Of course, it's a <i>completely useless</i> performance test. But that's very much in the spirit of Hello World.
