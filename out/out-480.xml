<title>Don't Forget To Lock Your Computer</title>

I encourage my coworkers to <b>lock their computers</b>. Security, after all, is everyone's business. But often gentle encouragement is not enough. Sometimes, more.. <i>persuasive</i> methods are necessary.
</p>
<p>
I first learned about the noble art of goating from <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/USBPCLock.aspx">from Omar Shahine</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
We have this problem in Hotmail. If you walk away from your desk, even for a brief moment, and your PC is left unlocked, someone will walk in, and send mail to a broad distribution list with something silly. Like "I like oranges", or worse things, some downright embarrassing. <b>For some reason this is called "Goating".</b> I find it incredibly annoying. My office has a lock on the door, so I am in the habit of keeping my door locked when I walk away.
</blockquote>
<p>
Goating techniques vary from insidious and subtle to invasive, borderline vandalism. I prefer the milder forms:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000452.html">the bluescreen screensaver</a>.
</li>
<li>Replacing the desktop with a screenshot of the desktop, and hiding all the visible items on it.
</li>
<li>Switching the mouse from right to left handed.
</li>
<li>Using the video driver settings to rotate the display left, right, or upside down.
</li>
<li>Switching the keyboard layout from QWERTY to Dvorak (or vice-versa).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Goating can be quite literal. I once walked back to my computer to find this:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="I've been goated!" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877702086970c" height="253" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877702086970c-pi.jpg" width="813">
</p>
<p>
It's disturbingly common here, which is why I've learned to reflexively <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000378.html">press Windows+L</a> when I get up from my desk.
</p>
<p>
One of my all-time favorite goating techniques, however, is to install <a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/default.shtml">the Clippy parody applet</a> on a victi.. er, coworker's machine. Who doesn't love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy">our old pal Clippy!</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/default.shtml"><img alt="Clippy: I thought you should know today is Wednesday, November 14, 2007." border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770208f970c" height="170" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770208f970c-pi.png" width="194"></a>
 
<a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/default.shtml"><img alt="Clippy: Your monitor is operational." border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770209d970c" height="170" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b01287770209d970c-pi.png" width="194"></a>
 
<a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/default.shtml"><img alt="Clippy: Sometimes I pop up for no particular reason, like now." border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777020a7970c" height="170" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777020a7970c-pi.png" width="199"></a>
</p>
<p>
After one particuarly inspired installation of Clippy, an email titled "What The Heck" went out to all employees:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
Is this another prank or something? What the heck is this Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ It's rude.
<p>
Look at the right hand corner of this image.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Clippy in action!" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777020bd970c" height="259" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777020bd970c-pi.jpg" width="259">
</p>
<p>
So far this stupid thing has told me:
</p>
<ol>
<li>My typing speed is slow.
</li>
<li>My productivity has been decreasing, I hope everything is Ok?
</li>
<li>My posture is degrading and I should reposition myself.
</li>
<li>Finally: It's time to play a game. Let's play hide-and-seek?
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Much hilarity ensued, and more importantly, <b>crucial lessons were learned about computer security by all</b>.
</p>
<p>
It's up to each of us to go forth and spread the good word! If just <i>one</i> person learns how important computer security is, your work here is done. Many additional goating techniques can be found in <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/46747/Tell-me-a-good-computer-prank">these</a> <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/45744/Boo-I-just-MacPwned-you">two</a> metafilter threads; <a href="http://officepoltergeist.com/">Office Poltergeist</a> looks quite promising, as does <a href="http://www.errmess.com/products.php">ErrMess</a>. And you really can't go wrong with <a href="http://www.rjlsoftware.com/software/entertainment/clippy/default.shtml">Clippy</a>.
</p>
<p>
But don't forget to lock <i>your</i> computer while you're out there spreading the word.
