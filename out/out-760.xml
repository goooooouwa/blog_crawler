Alex Gorbatchev, after a long hiatus, is <a href="http://www.dreamprojections.com/">blogging again</a>. What was keeping him away? <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000450.html">Frameworkitis</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
This is the longest break in posting I've had in the last 2.5 years of blogging. Community Server is really bringing me downÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I just don't like it.
<p>
So, I started working on my own blog engineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ for like the 6th time. This time it's different. It's actually moving ahead. Not so long ago I read an article about how to stay productive on a project. One thing that I took away from it, was the most crippling problem in all my previous projects - <b>procrastinating via developing frameworks. Every time I have started working on my own blog, I delved deep into creating frameworks and [needless] to say, none of my previous 5 attempts went even as far as being able to post a new entry.</b>
</p>
<p>
It really is very hard trying to stay away from creating libraries, thinking about future uses and what extra things I can put in that might used in the future. <b>Simply creating code that works and only does what I need it to really helps to move things ahead.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed.

<p>
Can you guess what the number one sin in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2006/08/03/687962.aspx">Eric Gunnerson's Seven Deadly Sins of Programming</a> is? I bet you can.
</p>
<p>
Although I'll admit I've been sorely tempted myself, I wonder if <a href="http://performancing.com/node/64">writing your own blog software</a> isn't a form of procrastination in and of itself.
