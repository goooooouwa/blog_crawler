Why is it, 10 years after the publication of Alan Cooper's seminal <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764526413/codihorr-20">About Face</a>, applications still regularly present this dialog to me?

Cooper said it best on page 136:
</p>
<blockquote>
It is possible to argue that users have come to expect this behavior; that its absence would cause experienced users to fret that changes were being mistakenly discarded when the program ends. <b>This rationale is like saying that a beaten dog expects to be beaten again, so we should beat it to make it happy. The time to make our programs better is now.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>
It never ceases to amaze me how little real progress is made in the area of UI. In this era of 300gb hard drives, I should never be explicitly prompted for much of anything. Save it all, and recall the stuff I need. Don't ask me for permission, just do it, and let me take it back later if I need to. Of course this is harder to program, but so what?
</p>
<p>
When presented with a database application for the first time, many users ask: "But how do I save?" Imagine that. An application that saves your work automatically. Revolutionary!
