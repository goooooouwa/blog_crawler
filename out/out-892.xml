<title>It's Better Than Nothing</title>

I was struck by this quote from a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060410fa_fact">New Yorker article on Muzak</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote><i>
"Our biggest competitor," a member of Muzak's marketing department told me, "is silence."
</i></blockquote>
<p>
The problem with comparing something to nothing is that nothing is, well, <i>nothing</i>. James Bach <a href="http://blackbox.cs.fit.edu/blog/james/archives/000188.html">elaborates</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
I was watching <a href="http://www.dcmt.cranfield.ac.uk/dois/ciseg/stuartreid">Dr. Stuart Reid</a> talk about model-based testing, some months ago. During the presentation, he complained that so few people used UML for model-making. Why don't more people use UML, he asked the audience?
</i><p>
I suppose his question was rhetorical, but I couldn't help myself. I called out "Because it's clunky!"
</p>
<p>
"It's better than nothing," he replied.
</p>
<p>
Think about that. Think about that phrase. <b>A comparison is offered between something and nothing. Who could prefer nothing? Nothing is a void.</b> It's scary and black. It makes us think about death. Ick. But wait a minute, the comparison that matters is not between something and nothing, it's probably between something and some other thing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As Bach points out, <b>any comparsion that ends in "It's better than nothing" is an invalid one</b>. There are <i>always</i> alternatives, whether the person speaking chooses to acknowledge them or not. Instead of UML, you could..
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>model in your head
</li>
<li>model via pencil and paper sketches
</li>
<li>model through your source code
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In my opinion, code is a perfectly reasonable place to model. That's why I was so encouraged by the fact that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/classdesigner/default.aspx">visual, two-way class modeling support</a> was pushed down from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/teamsystem/products/arch/">Visual Studio Team Edition for Software Architects</a> into almost all the editions of Visual Studio 2005 (Standard or better). It isn't formal UML, but it is a kinder, gentler modeling tool that <a href="http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/04/06/2531.aspx">a lot more people are likely to use</a>.
