From the "why I don't read Robert Scoble any more" <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/01/01/one-wish-for-2006/">department</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
One thing I wish is that Web site developers/designers would look at their site on a small screen with limited bandwidth. So many sites suck really bad. I'm going to call these sites out with increasing frequency in 2006.
<p>
If your site makes you scroll for 20 minutes just to see your content, it sucks. It'll get called out.
</p>
<p>
If your site squeezes a column so that it's only one word wide, it sucks. It'll get called out.
</p>
<p>
My wish? Please try your site on a cell phone (tonight I was comparing sites on a Treo, on a Blackbery, and on my phone. My phone was best, but there were lots of sites that sucked on all three).
</p>
<p>
Millions of Web users are out there with cell phones. If you don't get your site to work properly with a cell phone, you're turning away customers and that sucks. It'll get called out.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You know, it <i>would</i> be nice if <b>every single website was designed to scale perfectly across all resolutions from 176x220 to 1920x1440</b>.
</p>
<p>
It'd also be nice if trees were made of cotton candy, and rain was delicious lemonade.
</p>
<p>
This is what I refer to as <b>".. and a Pony!" thinking</b>: the person asking the question doesn't know that what they're asking for is essentially <i>impossible</i>. So you might as well throw a Pony in there while you're at it. Everyone loves Ponies.
</p>

<p>
I don't mean to single Robert out here. I'm sure he's a nice guy, but he's the absolute poster child for this phenomenon; it comes up over and over again in his blog.
</p>
<p>
It'd be helpful if he actually offered any thoughts on exactly how one would go about implementing a web site that <b>scales up seamlessly seventy times in resolution</b>. But <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2001/06/22">why explain yourself when you can just use magic?</a>
