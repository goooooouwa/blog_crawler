Seth Godin's <a href="http://www.salted.com/unsalted/files/knockknock.pdf">Incomplete Guide to Building a Web Site that Works</a> (6mb PDF) is a great reminder of <b>how to build a popular website without becoming a marketing weasel in the process</b>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Big Picture #1:</b><br>
A Web site must do at least one of two things, but probably both:
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn a stranger into a friend, and a friend into a customer.
</li>
<li>Talk in a tone of voice that persuades people to believe the story you're telling.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Big Picture #2:</b><br>
A Web site can cause only four things to happen in the moments after someone sees it:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>She clicks and goes somewhere else you want her to go.
</li>
<li>She clicks and gives you permission to follow up by email or phone.
</li>
<li>She clicks and buys something.
</li>
<li>She tells a friend, either by clicking or by blogging or phoning or talking.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
That's it.
</p>
<p>
If your site is attempting to do more than this, you're wasting time and money and, more important, focus.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you don't have a PDF reader already, I highly recommend <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit Reader</a>. It's a great, ultra-lightweight alternative to the bloated, naggy Acrobat Reader.
