I recently had the opportunity to rebuild my work PC. It strongly resembles the "Little Bang" D.I.Y. system I outlined in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000814.html">my previous post on the philosophy of building your own computer</a>.

</p>
<p>
See, I <i>do</i> take my own advice.
</p>
<p>
Here's a quick breakdown of the components and the rationale behind each. Every aspect of this system has been a blog post at one point or another.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>ASUS Vento 3600 case (green)</b>
<p>
Is there <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000218.html">anything more boring than a beige box?</a> The Vento is a little aggravating to work on, and it's a bit bulky. But it's unique, a total conversation starter, and the sparkly green model fits the Vertigo color scheme to a T. I even built my wife a PC using the red Vento. The 3600 has been discontinued in favor of <a href="http://www.directron.com/vento7700.html">the 7700</a>; the newest version is, sadly, much uglier.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>MSI P6N SLI, NVIDIA 650i chipset</b>
<p>
The 650i is a far more economic variation of the <a href="http://techreport.com/reviews/2006q4/nforce680i/index.x?pg=1">ridiculously expensive NVIDIA 680i chipset</a>, but offering the same excellent performance. Dual PCI express slots, for two video cards, is a must in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000740.html">my three-monitor world</a>. It also has a fairly large, passive thin-fin northbridge cooler; quality of the motherboard chipset cooling is important, because modern motherboard chipsets can dissipate upwards of 20-30 watts all by themselves. And it still runs blazingly hot, even at idle.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Intel Core 2 Duo E6600</b>
<p>
The Core 2 Duo is Intel's best processor in years. I opted for the E6600 because I have an unnatural love for large L2 caches, but even the cheapest Core Duo 2 runs rings around the competition. And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000697.html">all the Core 2 Duos overclock like mad</a>. This one is running at 3 GHz with a <i>very</i> minor voltage bump for peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Antec NeoHE 380 watt power supply</b>
<p>
Great modular cable power supply, with around 80% efficiency at typical load levels. It's extremely quiet, <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/article273-page1.html">per the SPCR review</a>. It's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000353.html">a myth that you "need" a 500 watt power supply</a>, but 380 W is about the lowest model you can buy these days. The <i>quality</i> of the power supply is far more important than any arbitrary watt number printed on its side.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Scythe Ninja heatsink</b>
<p>
The Ninja, despite the goofy name, offers superlative performance. It is easily <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/article251-page1.html">one of the all-time greatest heatsinks ever made</a>, and still a top-rank performer. It's quite inexpensive these days, too. As you can see, I am running it fanless. The Ninja is particularly suited for passive operation because of the widely-spaced fins. It's easily cooled passively, even under overclocked, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000657.html">dual prime 95 load</a>, by the 120 mm exhaust fan directly behind it. (Disclaimer: <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000707.html">I have a giant heatsink fetish</a>.)
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Dual passive GeForce 7600 GT 256 MB video cards</b>
<p>
The 7600 GT was the runaway champ in <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000662.html">the video card power/performance analysis</a> research I did last summer. The model I chose is a passively cooled, dual slot design from Gigabyte (<a href="http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/video/display/gigabyte-7600gt.html">model NX76T256D</a>). It offers outstanding performance, it runs cool, it has dual DVI, and the design is clever. I liked this card so much, I bought two of them. Not for SLI (although that's now an option) but for more than two monitors. It's inexpensive, too, at around $115 per card.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>2 GB of generic PC800 DDR2</b>
<p>
I don't believe in buying expensive memory. It's not worth it, unless you're an extreme overclocker. I buy cheap, reasonable quality memory. Even the cheap stuff overclocks fairly well, at least for the moderate overclocks I'm shooting for.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>74 GB 10,000 RPM primary hard drive</b>; 300 GB 7,200 RPM secondary hard drive
<p>
I cannot emphasize enough <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000800.html">how big the performance difference is between 10,000 RPM drives and 7,200 RPM drives</a>. I know it's a little expensive, but the merits of the faster drive, plus the flexibility of having two spindles in your system, makes it well worth the investment.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000665.html">it's quiet, too</a>. The entire system is cooled by three fans: one 120mm exhaust, the 80mm fan in the power supply, and an optional 80 mm fan I installed in the front of the case to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000748.html">keep hard drive temperatures down</a>. Airflow in the hard drive area is quite limited on the Vento.
</p>
<p>
One of the advantages of a D.I.Y. system is that <b>you can perform relatively inexpensive upgrades instead of buying an entirely new computer</b>. The most recent one was plopping in the new motherboard/cpu/memory/heatsink combo. With that upgrade, I now have a top of the line dual-core PC running at 3.0 GHz-- and it only cost me $650 to get there.
