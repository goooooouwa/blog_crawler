I'll be attending <a href="http://www.sdexpo.com/">SDWest 2006</a> all next week (March 13 - 17) in Santa Clara, California.
</p>
<p>
If you're attending, let's meet up somewhere! I've met a handful of people in person at past conferences:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/default.aspx">Sara Ford</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://hyperthink.net/blog/">Steve Maine</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://waltritscher.com/blog/ramblings/">Walt Rischler</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The highlight of SDWest, however, will hopefully be meeting <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/">Steve McConnell</a>, who is giving the keynote on Monday.
</p>

McConnell was <b>my first coding hero</b>.*
</p>
<p>
I discovered his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619670/codihorr-20">Code Complete</a> in 1994 and it was a revelation. Programming is such a solitary pursuit, and particularly so in those pre-internet days. In Code Complete, I found an amazingly passionate, incredibly literate, and consummately professional programmer to learn from. <b>Code Complete convinced me that writing software is what I want to do for the rest of my life</b>. The book-- now upgraded to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000022.html">version 2.0</a>-- has been my bible ever since.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b>: Steve was very gracious, talking at some length with me both before and after his keynote. He even signed my copy of Code Complete 2. As he said, "I guess I should sign on a page with a Coding Horror":

<p>
Who are your coding heroes-- and why?
</p>
<p>
* and hey, I'm <a href="http://activedeveloper.dk/weblogs/mrjs/gallery/image/2.aspx">not the only one</a>.
