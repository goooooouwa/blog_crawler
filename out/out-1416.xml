I like the way anyone can leave a comment regarding my posts-- the only good discussion is a two-way discussion-- but the comment spam is getting way out of hand (viagra, gambling, penis enlargement, ad nauseam). Thank goodness, then, for <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/">MT-blacklist</a>, a simple anti-spam plugin for Movable Type.
</p>
<p>
As promised, very easy to install, and based on a few of my tests, it definitely works! If you're interested-- and if you are using Movable Type 2.x, you should be-- check out <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/projects/mt-blacklist/latest/index">the documentation</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
p.s. SUCK IT SPAMMERS!
