Did you know that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/files/Win95-startup-sound.mp3">the Windows 95 startup sound</a> was composed by avant-garde electronic musician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Eno">Brian Eno</a>? I had no idea until I saw it referenced on <a href="http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2005/05/tiny-music-makers-pt-2-microsoft-sound.html">music thing</a>. Eno describes the process in a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/06/02/PK70006.DTL">1996 San Francisco Chronicle interview</a>:

Q: How did you come to compose "The Microsoft Sound''?
</i><p>
A: The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, "Here's a specific problem -- solve it.''
</p>
<p>
The thing from the agency said, "We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah- blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,'' this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said "and it must be 3 1/4 seconds long.''
</p>
<p>
I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel.
</p>
<p>
In fact, I made 84 pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rest of the <a href="http://musicthing.blogspot.com/2005/05/all-this-week-tiny-music-makers.html">tiny music makers series</a> are just as interesting, and a few of them are computer-related sounds you've probably heard before.
</p>
<p>
I distinctly remember the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1995/debut082495.htm">massive media blitz around Windows 95</a>, including <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=608&amp;">the use of the Rolling Stones' <i>Start Me Up</i></a>. I expect a similar media blitz for Windows Vista, which is arguably the most important consumer OS out of Redmond since 1995.
</p>
<p>
I'm not aware of any famous musical pedigrees for subsequent Windows start up sounds in Win98 and beyond. But I'm definitely glad we don't have <a href="http://www.prangstgrup.com/startupsound/">this startup sound</a>.
