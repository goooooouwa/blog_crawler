I arrived at work today to find this package.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="package mailer" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d2e970c" height="375" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/08/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d2e970c-pi.jpg" width="500">
</p>
<p>
It's from one "C. Petzold", <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000427.html">whoever the heck that is</a>.
</p>
<p>
Inside was a copy of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623945/codihorr-20">3D Programming for Windows: Three-Dimensional Graphics Programming for the Windows Presentation Foundation</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735623945/codihorr-20"><img alt="3D Programming for Windows: Three-Dimensional Graphics Programming for the Windows Presentation Foundation" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d36970c" height="489" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/08/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d36970c-pi.jpg" width="500"></a>
</p>
<p>
It's even inscribed:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="book inscription: Jeff, Hope you enjoy this one! (And I hope I didn't make too many coding or literary horrors.)" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d41970c" height="375" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/08/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877700d41970c-pi.jpg" width="500">
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, a reference to my post <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000846.html">How Not To Write a Technical Book</a>, in which I rather harshly called Petzold's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735619573/codihorr-20">previous book</a> "a greyscale sea of endless text and interminable code", and compared it very unfavorably with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672328917/codihorr-20">Adam Nathan's book on the same topic</a>.
</p>
<p>
I can't speak for the quality of the book, as I haven't had time to read it yet. But if nothing else, it tells us that Charles Petzold has a good sense of humor. (And, indirectly, it demonstrates <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000834.html">the value of an "about me" page on your blog</a> with your contact information.)
</p>
<p>
Thanks, Mr. Petzold.
