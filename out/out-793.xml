<title>DirectX Version Number Abuse</title>

Has anyone noticed that Microsoft defines "version" a little loosely when it comes to DirectX 9.0c? Here's a screenshot of the <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_directx/">DirectX 9.0c download page on FileHippo</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="DirectX 9.0c versions" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776febe2970c" height="296" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/08/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776febe2970c-pi.png" width="160">

<p>
DirectX 9.0c was originally released in August 2004, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">the DirectX Wikipedia entry</a>. But Microsoft has surreptitiously been updating DirectX 9.0c since August 2005 <i>without incrementing the version number.</i>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
It is not known why Microsoft has not used new version numbers for the updates to DX9.0c  --  including the December 2005 update versioning could now be at DX9.0j, although this is nowhere reflected in the internal code.
</blockquote>
<p>
So do you want version 9.0c, 9.0c, 9.0c, or perhaps.. 9.0c?
</p>
<p>
The versions are all fully backwards compatible, of course, but <b>why is Microsoft abusing version numbers this way?</b>
</p>
<p>
It's impossible to tell what version of DirectX 9.0 you're actually running. I've installed several games over the past year which inexplicably demanded to re-install DirectX 9.0c; now I know why.
</p>
<p>
At least Vista stops the madness by <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=26220">finally changing the version number to DirectX 9.0L</a>.
