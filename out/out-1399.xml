I'm currently building a .NET library that constructs .MHT files, aka single file web page archives. That's what you get when you perform a <b>File | Save As | Web Archive, Single File</b> operation in IE6. HTML is a great, standard format for building richly formatted one-off reports, but once you start including images, it becomes a pain to manage a set of files. Thus, the utility of combining everything into a single file.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, instead of some crazy proprietary Microsoft format like you'd expect, the file follows the simple <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2557.txt">Multipart MIME Message RFC</a> standard. Building an .MHT file is sort of like sending an email to yourself-- go figure. It also works in <a href="http://maf.mozdev.org/">via extension</a> in your precious Firefox, for those of you that enjoy slow rendering.
</p>
<p>
During development, I needed to reverse engineer what IE6 constructs, and use that as a comparison point for the output from my application. Unfortunately, the only file comparison tool I had access to was the crappy default "compare versions" function in Visual SourceSafe. It's workable, but it's kind of.. ghetto.
</p>
<p>
Every developer should have a good diff tool in their toolkit. After a bit of research, I settled on <a href="http://www.araxis.com/merge/">Araxis Merge</a> as my preferred tool for visual comparisons.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>It's a pricey tool, but it's come in very handy so far. The only regret I have is that VSS doesn't allow the use of any external comparison tools, so you can't integrate Merge with Visual Studio .NET.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if like me, the only diff tool you ever used was the one in VSS-- you may not know how much you're missing.
