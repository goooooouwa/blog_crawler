<a href="http://juicability.blogspot.com/2005/09/top-8-reasons-hci-is-in-its-stone-age.html">The Top 8 reasons user interface design is in the stone age</a> is more of a rant than a reasoned argument, but it's still worth reading. If UI design is in the stone age, why are there at least two sites which document known UI patterns?

I think we've come a long way from <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000171.html">the stone age</a>-- particularly after sitting through some very impressive demos of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/pdc/gallery.mspx">the Windows Vista and Office 12 UIs</a> at PDC 2005 today. But it's true that there's still much to be done.

I was struck by <b>how aggressively Microsoft has folded web metaphors into Vista and Office</b>-- things like the forward and back buttons, focusing on a single task per page, and the ubiquitous search box. I've <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000089.html">talked about this before</a>, and I'm glad to see Microsoft leading the way.

Speaking of Vista, <a href="http://miksovsky.blogs.com/flowstate/">Flowstate</a> is a great UI blog from an ex-UI architect for Windows Vista. Prior to Vista, he worked on Money-- one of the first <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnforms/html/winforms07202004.asp">inductive user interfaces</a>.
