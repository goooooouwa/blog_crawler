I generally dislike these kinds of "Me, too!" posts, but I have to make an exception for Ned Batchelder's <a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/text/deleting-code.html">excellent blog entry on deleting code</a>. I've often run into this phenomenon with other developers, and it bugged the heck out of me, although I couldn't quantify exactly why. Well, now I can:
</p>
<blockquote>
If you have a chunk of code you don't need any more, there's one big reason to delete it for real rather than leaving it in a disabled state: to reduce noise and uncertainty. Some of the worst enemies a developer has are noise or uncertainty in his code, because they prevent him from working with it effectively in the future.
<p>
A chunk of code in a disabled state just causes uncertainty. It puts questions in other developers' minds:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did the code used to be this way?
</li>
<li>Why is this new way better?
</li>
<li>Are we going to switch back to the old way?
</li>
<li>How will we decide?
</li>
</ul>
If the answer to one of these questions is important for people to know, then write a comment spelling it out. Don't leave your co-workers guessing.
</blockquote>
I have been angrily accused of deleting someone's commented code on more than one occasion. I say, give me a reason not to delete it, and I won't. Otherwise, it's fair game. In my experience this kind of "oh, I'll get back to it" code just sits in the codebase forever, junking up the works for every future developer.
