The <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000209.html">standard computer keyboard</a> is the quintessential human input device. Although it's amazingly adaptable, a recent <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/game/20050308/">Tom's Hardware review of the Ergodex DX1</a> underscores the limitations of the keyboard as an input device-- and also highlights some of the crazier keyboard alternatives out there:

So far, technology hasn't provided us with the ability to customize a hardware interface that meets our individual needs. Thus, we are usually forced to retreat to the 138-year-old quintessence of ubiquity: <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~dcrehr/whyqwert.html">Christopher Sholes' "QWERTY" keyboard</a>.

This is a collection of just a few of the author's pit stops along his quest to find the perfect input peripheral. (The rest can be found in a landfill somewhere.) They are, clockwise from the top: The <a href="http://www.avault.com/hardware/getreview.asp?review=idizmsd&amp;page=2">Devilfish</a>, <a href="http://www.saitek.com/uk/prod/gamerskey.htm">Saitek Command Pad</a>, <a href="http://www.zboard.com/">Ideazon Zboard</a>, Essential Reality's <a href="http://www.vrealities.com/P5.html">P5 Glove</a>, Belkin's <a href="http://catalog.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Merchant_Id=&amp;Section_Id=2071&amp;pcount=&amp;Product_Id=157024">Nostromo Speedpad N52</a>, and Microsoft's <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Reviews/strategiccommander/">Strategic Commander</a>.

Keyboard alternatives have always fascinated me. I've owned two of the peripherals the author lists, and I recently ordered the <a href="http://www.ergodex.com/">Ergodex DX1</a>.

Unfortunately, my unit arrived DOA and is in the process of being exchanged, but you can read reviews of this unique "have it your way" keyboard in the following places:

</ul>
<p>
None of these devices, including the Ergodex, are positioned as true "throw away your keyboard" alternatives. I'm not sure that's even possible; I can tell you from personal experience that <b>the struggle to defeat a decade of existing keyboard muscle memory is a losing battle</b>. It's really <a href="http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/dissent.html">the same problem the Dvorak keyboard layout has always had</a>. However, these keyboard alternative don't replace but <i>complement</i> your existing keyboard by presenting an optimized subset of what you already know. Even then, it's a tricky business. But I suspect that the extreme flexibility of the Ergodex will make it workable where all the others failed.
