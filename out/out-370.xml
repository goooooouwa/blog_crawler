<title>Is HTML a Humane Markup Language?</title>

One of the things we're thinking about while building <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a> is <b>how to let users style the questions and answers they're entering on the site</b>. Nothing's decided at this point, but we definitely <i>won't</i> be giving users one of those friendly-but-irritating HTML GUI browser layout controls.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I have one iron-clad design guide: <b>this is a site for programmers, so they should be comfortable with basic markup</b>. None of that nancy-boy GUI toolbar handholding nonsense for us, thankyouverymuch. If you can sling code, a little bit of presentation markup is child's play.
</p>
<p>
We will support some sort of markup language to style the questions and answers. But <i>what</i> markup language?
</p>
<p>
I mentioned in <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/index.php/2008/05/podcast-4/">podcast #4</a> that we consider Wikipedia a defining influence. Let's see how Wikipedia handles markup syntax. This is what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joel_Spolsky&amp;action=edit">edit page for Joel Spolsky's Wikipedia entry</a> looks like:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joel_Spolsky&amp;action=edit"><img alt="Wikipedia Edit page for Joel Spolsky entry" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777041ec970c" height="458" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2008/05/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777041ec970c-pi.png" width="628"></a>
</p>
<p>
It's an effective markup language, but I think you'll agree that it's more intimidating than <i>humane</i>. Wikipedia's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page">How to Edit a Page</a> and the accompanying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet">Wikipedia syntax cheatsheet</a> helps. Some. I'd argue that writing a Wikipedia entry is a step beyond mere presentational markup; it's almost like <i>coding</i>, as you weave the article into the Wikipedia gestalt. (Incidentally, if you haven't ever edited a Wikipedia article, you should. I consider it a rite of passage, a sort of internet merit badge for anyone who is serious about their online presence.)
</p>
<p>
Let's consider a simpler example. What we're looking for is some kind of middle ground, a <a href="http://bluebones.net/2005/02/humane-text-formats/">humane text format</a>. Let's start with some basic HTML.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" width="600">

<h1>Lightweight Markup Languages</h1>
<p>According to <b>Wikipedia</b>:</p>
<blockquote>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lightweight_markup_languages">lightweight markup language</a> is a markup language with a simple syntax, designed to be easy for a human to enter with a simple text editor, and easy to read in its raw form.

<ul>
<li>Markdown

<li>Textile

<p>
Markup should also extend to <i>code</i>:
</p>
<pre>
10 PRINT "I ROCK AT BASIC!"
20 GOTO 10
</pre>
</td></tr>

<p>
Here's what that looks like expressed in a variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lightweight_markup_languages">lightweight markup languages</a>. Bear in mind that <b>each of these will produce HTML equivalent to the above</b>.

==Lightweight Markup Languages==
According to '''Wikipedia''':
:A [[lightweight markup language]]
is a markup language with a simple syntax, designed
to be easy for a human to enter with a simple text

Some examples are:
* Markdown
* Textile
* BBCode
* Wikipedia
Markup should also extend to ''code'':
&lt;source lang=qbasic&gt;
10 PRINT "I ROCK AT BASIC!"
20 GOTO 10

None of these lightweight markup languages are particularly difficult to understand -- and they're easy on the eyes, as promised. But I still had to look up the reference syntax for each one and map it to the HTML that I already know by heart. I also found them disturbingly close to "magic" for some of the formatting rules, to the point that I wished I could just write literal HTML and get exactly what I want without guessing how the parser is going to interpret my fake-plain-text.
</p>
<p>
Which leads directly to this question: <b>why not just stick with what we already know and use HTML?</b> This c2 wiki page titled <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/fullSearch">Why Doesn't Wiki Do HTML?</a> makes the case that -- at least for Wiki content -- you're better off leaving HTML behind:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>In a Wiki, the emphasis is on content, not presentation. Simple Wiki markup rules let people focus on expressing their ideas.
</li>
<li>Why not use a domain-specific markup language designed to do "the simplest thing that could possibly work"?
</li>
<li>Some HTML tags are difficult to work with and can break the flow of your thoughts. The table tag, for example.
</li>
<li>Does the average user really need total HTML and CSS layout power?
</li>
<li>Allowing the full range of HTML tags can lead to major security vulnerabilities.
</li>
<li>Many people don't know HTML. A simple Wiki markup language is easier to learn.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I'm not sure I agree with all of this, but it can make sense in the context of a full-blown Wiki. It's worth considering.
</p>
<p>
After all this research on humane markup languages, much to my chagrin, I've come full circle. <b>I now no longer think humane markup languages make sense for most uses</b>. I agree with the guy at fileformat.info -- <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/news/2005/03/04/humane_text_formats.htm">HTML is generally the better choice</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Simplicity</b>
<p>If the source and destination are the web, why not use the native markup language of the web?
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Readability</b>
<p>HTML is a bit less readable than the lightweight markup languages, it's true. But basic HTML is not onerous to read, particularly if we hide the repetitive paragraph tags.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Security</b>
<p>
With a bit of careful coding, it is possible to whitelist specific HTML tags that you will allow. This way you avoid exposing yourself to risky/vulnerable tags.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Conversion</b>
<p>
It's not at all clear that <i>any</i> existing lightweight markup language has critical mass, with the possible exception of Wikipedia's flavor. On the other hand, text parsers and tools will always understand HTML.
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>What people know</b>
<p>
A lot more people know HTML than any given flavor of humane text. If you're a programmer, you damn well <i>better</i> know HTML. For the handful of wiki-like functions we may need, it's possible to add some optional attributes to the HTML tags. And wouldn't that be easier to learn than some weird, pseudo-ASCII derivation of HTML?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I do think we'll adopt some of the cleverer functions of Textile and Markdown, insofar as they remove mundane HTML markup scutwork. But in general, <b>I'd much rather rely on a subset of trusty old HTML</b> than expend brain cells trying to <a href="http://hobix.com/textile/quick.html">remember the fake-HTML way</a> to make something bold, or create a hyperlink. HTML isn't perfect, but it's an eminently reasonable humane markup language.
