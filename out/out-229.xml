                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If we geeks obsessively optimize <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/08/whats-on-your-utility-belt.html">what's on our keychain</a>, we'd be remiss if we didn't also obsessively optimize that <em>other</em> item most geeks carry around – our <strong>wallet</strong>.</p>
<p>My current Tumi wallet was almost 10 years old and starting to show its age. While I never had an enormous <a href="http://www.seinology.com/scripts/script-168.shtml">Constanza Wallet</a>, I felt I could do better.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yoPf98i8A0g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>I was in the market for a new wallet, but I wanted something… <em>less</em>. In search of an alternative, a coworker turned me on to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E1GRIO/?tag=codihorr-20">superthin All-Ett wallet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E1GRIO/?tag=codihorr-20"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86e2017970b-pi.jpg" border="0" alt="all-ett-wallet" width="385" height="229"><br>
</a></p>
<p>After seeing the All-Ett, I was sold. I ordered one. As promised, <strong>the fully populated All-ett was thinner – much thinner! – than my old wallet was <em>empty</em>.</strong> Amazing! It's so much more comfortable to sit down with this in my back pocket. I no longer feel motivated to remove my wallet from my back pocket when I sit down. That's important. I don't know about you guys, but I tend to lose my wallet when I leave it lying around various places. Not good.</p>
<p>I only have two minor criticisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The ultra-thin spinnaker sailcloth they use is a tiny bit "crackly" in use. It's not a problem in practical use, you can't hear yourself sit down, but it is a little disconcerting at first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The orientation of the pockets means the contents tend to fall towards the middle when you open it. It's a little more fiddly than a typical wallet when opening it and fishing items out of it. But given that I tend to open my wallet maybe 3-4 times per day, at most, that's a tradeoff I'm willing to make.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Minus those minor criticisms, I'm very happy with it. Or at least I <em>was</em>, until I discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fgw%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DDynomighty%2520mighty%2520wallet%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=codihorr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Tyvek Mighty Wallets</a> – which even come in a glorious <b>fake dot matrix printout style!</b> Be still, my beating geek heart! Since the sailcloth of the all-ett proved a bit problematic, I'm thinking the Tyvek might be a better choice, and placing my new wallet order. Plus: digits of π! On a dot matrix print-out! Come on, man!</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Update</span>: I'm happy to report that I used my Mighty Wallet for years, and just decided to replace it in April 2013 (and again in June 2017) as it was finally getting a bit beat up. Since then, there's been an explosion of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fgw%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3DDynomighty%2520mighty%2520wallet%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps&amp;tag=codihorr-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">amazing Mighty Wallet styles</a>. I liked my old dot matrix model so much I bought three new ones!</p>

<p>But there are other popular geek wallets, too, that I've either had directly recommended to me or seen people use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.thejimi.com/">Jimi Wallet</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZJACFA/?tag=codihorr-20">Umbra Bungee Card Case</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The even smaller <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LBT5PJY/?tag=codihorr-20">Junior All-Ett</a> (with only two pockets instead of four)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006LQLSFS/?tag=codihorr-20">The Thin Super Skinny Wallet</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00013D2NI/?tag=codihorr-20">Slimmy: The Slim Front Pocket Wallet Alternative</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the ones I see recommended most, but there are plenty of alternatives discussed in similar posts on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/21/minimalist-wallet">43folders</a> and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/wallet_roundup.php">37signals</a>.</p>
<p>On a related note, I've always wished I could carry a pen, but I've never found one small and convenient enough to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/updating-your-utility-belt/">add to my existing keychain</a>. There's quite a bit of stuff on there already: a LED flashlight, a Leatherman Squirt, and of course my keys. I'm not sure if I want to add a pen to that list. But there's another way: <strong>I can carry a pen in my wallet!</strong> I found two wallet pens that could work.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.derringerpen.com/">Derringer Wallet Pen</a> is only $8. Unfortunately, it was slightly too large for my old wallet at 4" long. So I had to give it away.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.derringerpen.com/"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86e201f970b-pi.jpg" border="0" alt="derringer-wallet-pen" width="235" height="270"><br>
</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N6BA10P/?tag=codihorr-20">wallet pen</a> is quite a bit more expensive at <s>$40</s> $70. But it's made of sterling silver, and most importantly, it's only 3" and even thinner. So it's even more portable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.styluscentral.com/walletpen.html"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86e2024970b-pi.jpg" border="0" alt="wallet-pen-sterling-silver" width="239" height="103"><br>
</a></p>
<p>The wallet pen, as small as it is, fits perfectly in the "crease" of a typical wallet. It does bulge up a tiny bit in the super thin All-ett (and we'll see how it does in the Tyvek wallet), but it still works.</p>
<p>Why not <strong>optimize your wallet</strong>? You could end up carrying something that's more comfortable, way thinner, and maybe even have something around to write with, too!</p>
