A reader recently pointed out that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321344758/codihorr-20">the second edition of Don't Make Me Think</a> is about to be released. I know I've pimped this book ad nauseam, but I can't help myself-- it's just that good. <b>If you only read one book on usability and UI, it should be Krug's Don't Make Me Think.</b> I even gave it to my wife to read, and she enjoyed it too. Is there any higher praise?

Unfortunately, Steve Krug's website <a href="http://www.sensible.com/secondedition/index.html">doesn't have any information on what's new in this version</a>. The yellow sidebar indicates "3 new chapters", but beyond that, who knows.
</p>
<p>
I'll be getting a copy of the new version for sure. I can keep the old one at home and the new one at work, or I can surprise an unsuspecting manager or fellow developer with the first edition. Now if only I could get them to <i>read</i> it..
