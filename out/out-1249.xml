                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The appeal of the Mac Mini is totally lost on me. It's an underpowered,  expensive box-- like every other computer Apple has ever introduced. And yet, a certain contingent of PC users are buying this thing on release day. I never understood that.</p>
<p>Ed Stroglio may be the best industry analyst you've never heard of. Check out the way he totally nailed the appeal of the Mac Mini: <a href="http://www.overclockers.com/here-comes-the-cmac/">screwdrivers vs. couture</a>:</p>
<blockquote>For PCers, a computer is a tool, an animated screwdriver. You don't have an "experience" with a screwdriver. It either works well or it doesn't. If it does, you like it; if it doesn't, you don't. You don't admire its aesthetic features, or find one a reflection of your good taste, or a symbol that proves you're an {fill in the blanks: admirable, special, creative, artistic} person.
<p>For Macsters, it's just the opposite. The object is an extension of themselves just as much as their clothing or interior decoration, it's a part of them in a way a PC never is for a PCer.</p>
<p>One might think case modders or overclockers [or developers] in general might be more prone to the Mac outlook, but that's not really so. <strong>What such people are proud of is not mere ownership of the equipment, but what they've done to it to make it what it is.</strong> It's a much more hands-on sense of accomplishment: what has been done rather than what it was out of the box.</p>
<p>For such people, telling them that a Dell is cheaper and better is like telling them that Old Navy overalls are cheaper and last longer than Dolce &amp; Gabbana jeans. When you do that, what they hear is, "Be a common pig like the rest of us" when the whole point of the purchase is to prove the opposite.</p>
<p>If this is incomprehensible to you, well, that's why you own a PC and not a Mac.</p>
<p>But if this description sounds like someone you know who is already a Mac user, or is prone to becoming one, this is why the standard arguments for buying a PC falls on deaf ears. <strong>You're thinking screwdriver; they're thinking fashion outfit. </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's one of those "aha" moments, because the appeal of the Mac Mini really was incomprehensible to me. There's a bit more followup on Ed's site about some of the <a href="http://www.overclockers.com/articles1175/">subtler points in the PC vs. Mac comparison</a>.</p>
