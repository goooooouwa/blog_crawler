There's so much buzz around Flickr right now it's practically deafening. Or maybe I should say <i>blinding</i>, because Flickr is a collaborative photo sharing service. I was perplexed why Yet Another Photo Sharing Website was so hot until I started browsing the myriad hacks and tools available for this site. Flickr has a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">web API</a>, and there's a .NET wrapper around that API available at <a href="http://flickrdotnet.wdevs.com/Default.aspx?tabid=56">Flickr.NET</a>. It's truly astonishing; a case study in what having an open API and community-driven content can do for your business. Here are some of the cooler Flickr hacks (warning-- heavy use of Flash ahead)
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://krazydad.com/colrpickr/">Flickr color picker</a>. Shows all pictures for any given color you click in the color wheel. Quite mesmerizing.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/flickr_postcard_browser/app/">Flickr postcard browser</a>. Photos are "tagged" in Flickr with various descriptive words by the users. This is a quick way to browse around a specific tag.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.airtightinteractive.com/projects/related_tag_browser/app/">Flickr related tag browser</a>. This is like the postcard browser, but it also shows related tags that are frequently associated with whatever tag you're browsing in a ring around the pictures. Fantastic for browsing around and getting a sense of what tags are in use.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.marumushi.com/apps/flickrgraph/flickrgraph.cfm">FlickrGraph</a>. Flickr also contains social networks-- users who mark each other's photos as "favorites". This tool lets you map out the relationships between users in graphical form.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.kokogiak.com/flickreplacr.html">Flickr Replacer</a>. A neat bookmarklet that takes any highlighted word on the web page and replaces it with an image representing that word (via tags, of course). Perfect for getting your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebus">rebus</a> on.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://metaatem.net/words/test">Spell with Flickr</a>. Spells a word of your choice using Flickr images representing each of the letters.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you can see from the above sampling, <b>Flickr is all about tags</b>. There's a neat <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/">page on Flickr that shows the most popular tags at any given moment</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amateur photographers take far better pictures, on the whole, than I could have ever possibly imagined. After seeing this, who needs professional photographers? Still, there's a big gap between the good and great pictures. My biggest frustration with flickr is that <b>there's no rating system for the pictures</b>. You can only browse pictures by user, or by keyword. I have a hard time coming up with tag keywords (frogs? dogs? clouds? graffiti?), and I don't really know any Flickr users. I'd rather just subscribe to some feed of highly rated pictures. Sort of an <a href="http://amihotornot.com">AmIHOTorNOT</a> for photos, but hopefully without the prurience and desperation.
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, only the tip of the iceberg. There's an exhaustive list of all the Flickr hacks at <a href="http://pchere.blogspot.com/2005/03/great-flickr-tools-collection.html">The Great Flickr Tools Collection</a>.
