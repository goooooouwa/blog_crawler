Our old friend, the OK Button, has gone through a few visual tweaks in the last twenty years of Windows:

<p>
There is one constant, however: the use of OK. It's an abbreviated form of Okay. But where did this word, and its convenient two-letter abbreviation, come from? The question is answered in <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250">this straight dope column on the etymology of OK</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
The etymology of OK was masterfully explained by the distinguished Columbia University professor Allen Walker Read in a series of articles in the journal American Speech in 1963 and 1964.
</i><p>
The letters, not to keep you guessing, stand for "oll korrect." They're the result of a fad for comical abbreviations that flourished in the late 1830s and 1840s.
</p>
<p>
Read buttressed his arguments with hundreds of citations from newspapers and other documents of the period. As far as I know his work has never been successfully challenged.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okay">Wikipedia entry on OK</a> offers many other theories on the etymology of the word-- but the timing of the first written appearance seems to support Reed.
