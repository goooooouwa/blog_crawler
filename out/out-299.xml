I've been a fan of Dan Appleman for about as long as I've been a professional programmer. He is one of my heroes. Unfortunately, Dan only <a href="http://www.danappleman.com/">blogs</a> rarely, so I was heartened to see a spate of recent blog updates from him. One of the entries asks a question I've often wondered myself: <a href="http://www.danappleman.com/?p=68">can you really rent a coder?</a>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
Over the past year or two I've kept an eye on the various online consulting sites - <a href="http://www.elance.com/">Elance</a>, <a href="http://www.guru.com/">guru.com</a>, <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/">RentACoder</a>, <a href="http://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a>. I've actually used RentACoder once (as a buyer on a very small project) and was satisfied with the results -- though I suspect I spent more time writing the spec and managing the programmers than I would if I had done the work myself.
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm surprised Dan opens with such a sunny outlook on these services, because I've heard almost universally negative things about them. As professional programmers, I think we're all naturally inclined to <b>see these sort of low-bid contract sites as cannibalizing and cheapening our craft.</b> It's roughly analogous to the <a href="http://www.no-spec.com/">No-Spec movement</a> for designers.
</p>
<p>
The odd thing is that, despite the sunny outlook, <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-1652-Gadgets-Examiner~y2008m11d14-oDesk-Guru-Elance-and-RentACoder--Are-they-worth-it">the article Dan wrote on this topic</a> comes across as quite cautionary:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>You'll be competing with people around the world.</b> In fact, you'll be amazed at how little people in some parts of the world will bid. That's because a few dollars an hour can work well in a country where the average wage is a couple of hundred dollars a month.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>Many of the projects posted are unrealistic</b>. For example, people asking for a clone of ebay for under $500. What ends up happening in these cases is that usually somebody ends up getting ripped off (either the client or the consultant who underbid or fails to deliver).<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<b>A lot of projects go bad.</b> They get cancelled. Or the consultant who bid on the work never delivered, or delivered poor results. Or the client has unreasonable expectations, or doesn't actually know what he wants.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Maybe it's just my natural bias talking, but these sites seem awfully impractical to me.
</p>
<p>
Simply sorting out the DailyWTF project pitches from things you could actually deliver -- at ultra-competitive offshore programming rates, no less -- would require the patience of a saint and the endurance of an olympic athlete. Specification documents are hard enough to write when everyone involved is a coworker sitting in the same room. I can't even imagine the difficulty of <b>agreeing on what it is you're building</b> when the participants are thousands of miles away and have never met. But then <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000828.html">I thought Amazon's Mechanical Turk was a failure</a>, and it seems to be enjoying a moderate level of success.
</p>
<p>
Dan has a small chart <a href="http://thethriftygeek.com/2008/11/comparing-the-online-consulting-sites/">comparing the services of these online freelance/consulting sites</a>. It's too easy to write these sites off as an affront to software engineering. I guess they're <b>sort of like dating sites</b> -- they might be one way to find a client relationship, but I'd be highly suspicious of any professional developer who can't find a stable, long term relationship with a client eventually.
</p>
<p>
If nothing else, we should be looking at them for research purposes, as a baseline. Surely you can demonstrate better value to your employer than the random, anonymous programmers on <a href="http://www.elance.com/">Elance</a>, <a href="http://www.guru.com/">guru.com</a>, <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/">RentACoder</a>, or <a href="http://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a>. And I'd certainly hope that the projects you're working on are more sensible and rewarding (in both senses of the word) than the stuff that appears on those sites.
