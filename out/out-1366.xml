I talked in a previous post about <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000062.html">Unbreakable Links</a>-- that is, stating every URL in terms of a Google search rather than an absolute address. Great concept, but how do you determine which words on a web page are most likely to generate a unique search result? Well, wonder no more:
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/linktron5k/"><b>Behold the Incredible LinkTron5000 (tm)!</b></a>
</p>
<p>
As you might imagine, this involves quite a bit of google abuse -- all of which is pre-cached for performance. Well, mostly pre-cached. If you have a page with a lot of words that I can't find in a dictionary, the LinkTron will take a little while to process it.

When researching this project, I found an invaluable source of information at Philipp Lenssen's <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/">Google Blogoscoped</a>. For instance, this frequency distribution for <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2003_11_03_index.html">the 26,000 most used words online</a>. There's also a cool <a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/text-color/">word frequency colorizer</a> which visually depicts the "uniqueness" of a target URL.
