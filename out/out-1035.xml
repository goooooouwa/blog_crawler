Software engineers aren't the only ones <a href="http://www.eeggs.com/tree/153.html">planting secret easter eggs in their products</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here's a fun article on the
<a href="http://news.com.com/What+art+is+hiding+on+your+microchip/2100-1006_3-5893374.html">hidden art etched into microchips</a>. There are a handful of images in the article, but many more at the Silicon Zoo website. Here's one I found of Mr. T on, appropriately enough, a <b>T1 transceiver integrated circuit</b>:

Notice the medallion says "T1". Who said hardware engineers didn't have a sense of humor?

If you want to see more of these hardware in-jokes, visit the <a href="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/creatures/index.html">Molecular Expressions: Silicon Zoo page</a> and scroll down past the interactive Java tutorial image in the middle of the page. Direct links to the rest of the chip images start just below there.
