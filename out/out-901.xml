If you ..
</p>
<ul>
<li>use Windows XP SP2 of any flavor
</li>
<li>have 1+ gigabytes or more of system memory
</li>
<li>use hibernate functionality
</li>
</ul>
<p>
.. you may have experienced this error at some point when attempting to hibernate:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Windows - System Error: Insufficient system resources exist to complete the API." border="0" height="87" src="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/insufficient-system-resources.png" width="374">
</p>
<p>
I know I have. It drives me nuts, because my system fails to hibernate after I've already initiated the hibernation process and walked away from it. This is on my desktop*. You can imagine how catastrophic this could be on a laptop; you'd be putting a laptop in your bag that was still fully on!
</p>
<p>
To avoid the error, install <a href="http://www.u-g-h.com/InsufficientSystemResourcesExistToCompleteTheAPISOLIVED.aspx">this Microsoft hotfix</a>, which is graciously hosted by Owen Cutajar. It's from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=909095">Microsoft KB909095</a>, which also explains the problem in a bit more detail:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>
To prepare the computer to hibernate, the Windows kernel power manager requires a block of contiguous memory. The size of this contiguous memory is proportional to the number of physical memory regions that the computer is using. A computer that uses lots of RAM is likely to use more physical memory regions when the computer prepares to hibernate. Therefore, a larger amount of contiguous memory is required to prepare the computer to hibernate.
</i><p>
Additionally, the number of physical memory regions varies according to the programs, services, and device drivers that the computer uses. Therefore, the hibernate feature occasionally fails.
</p>
<p>
When the Windows kernel power manager detects that the hibernate feature has failed, the hibernate feature remains disabled until you restart the computer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I originally researched this <a href="http://www.ntwizards.net/2004/10/13/hibernate">back in December</a>, but the problem wasn't happening with enough frequency to make me call Microsoft support and dig up a hotfix. Now it is. And people have mirrored the patch so we don't have to go through <b>the busywork exercise of calling Microsoft support to obtain a necessary hotfix.</b> What a ridiculous policy.
</p>
<p>
* I would use sleep, but the motherboard I use isn't smart enough to restore the correct overclocked CPU speed. I get bumped down to stock CPU speeds every time I resume from a sleep state.
