I've been traveling a bit more lately, which reminded me to update my list of <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000155.html">recommended laptop travel accessories</a>.
</p>
<p>
Although I was happy with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=070">Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse</a>, the snap-in power off switch never worked very well for me. As a result, it got switched on a few times in my laptop bag, leaving me with a dead mouse when I needed it. So I needed a <b>new notebook mouse</b>. I switched to the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2146,CONTENTID=9508">Logitech V500</a>:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Logitech V500 Mouse" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d601f970b" height="223" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d601f970b-pi.jpg" width="300">
</p>
<p>
It's got a neat pop-up panel on the bottom which serves three functions:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>it's a power switch
</li>
<li>it provides a larger, angled profile for comfort
</li>
<li>it serves as a secure storage compartment for the wireless USB receiver
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The solid-state scrolling surface (instead of a wheel) takes a little getting used to, but it works well, and there's a satisfying audible click that plays as you "scroll." It takes up less space than any of the Microsoft notebook mice, too.
</p>
<p>
If you've ever been trapped at a crowded airport with all the power outlets occupied by opportunistic travellers, you'll wish you had brought <b>a mini power strip</b> with you. The <a href="http://www.monstercable.com/power/lineOutlets.asp">Monster Cable Outlets to Go</a> mini power strip looks like it will fit the bill nicely:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Too bad it's not available yet. If you can't wait, most hardware stores carry the good old three-port power outlet expander:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
I also occasionally need to <b>network multiple PCs on the road</b>. Given the prices of today's routers, there's absolutely no reason to carry something that's merely a switch or hub. Consider the <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1115416825655&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">Linksys WRT54GC compact wireless router</a>, which I picked up on eBay for under $40 shipped:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="wrt54gc in a person's hand" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6050970b" height="256" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6050970b-pi.jpg" width="300">
</p>
<p>
The newer <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Product_C2&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1122062241008&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">Wireless-G Travel Router</a> is even smaller, and it plugs directly into the wall, obviating the need for any external power brick.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Linksys Wireless-G Travel Router" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6073970b" height="271" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/06/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6073970b-pi.jpg" width="300">
</p>
<p>
However, it only has one client ethernet port, so it's not suitable as a wired switch. That's kind of a bummer.
</p>
<p>
I still recommend (and use) my <a href="http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=32&amp;FamID=60&amp;ProdID=280">external USB wireless antenna</a>, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=retractable+cable+kit">retractable cable kit</a>. Oh yeah, and the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000167.html">portable laptop stand</a> can be a lifesaver, too.
