As far as I'm concerned, <b>Windows Media Center is one of the best-- if not <i>the</i> best-- applications Microsoft has ever created</b>. And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000542.html">it was written in .NET</a> to boot.
</p>
<p>
I've been a huge MCE enthusiast since the original version was released in 2003, so I was greatly looking forward to the Vista edition of Media Center. I've slowly been upgrading <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000221.html">my Home Theater PC</a> over the last two years in anticipation of the shift to Vista:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>2.1 GHz Pentium-M "Dothan"
</li>
<li>AOpen i855GMEm mobo
</li>
<li>GeForce 7600GS, 256 MB, AGP 4x
</li>
<li>2 GB RAM
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/pages/products/data_pvr500mce.html">Hauppauge PVR-500 MCE dual tuner</a> (highly recommended)
</li>
<li>1 TB storage (dual 500 GB <a href="http://www.silentpcreview.com/article617-page1.html">low-noise SATA drives</a>)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Eventually I want to <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000746.html">plop an internal HD-DVD drive</a> in this machine once prices and configurations stabilize. But that's probably another 8-12 months out.
</p>
<p>
This weekend I took the plunge and upgraded my HTPC from Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 to Windows Vista Home Premium. I wasn't disappointed. <b>Vista's Media Center is a vast improvement over XP's Media Center</b>. It's faster, it's prettier, and it's thoroughly improved in every way.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Windows Vista Media Center, Recorded TV" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ff9e8970c" height="480" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ff9e8970c-pi.jpg" width="848">
</p>
<p>
The default UI makes better use of the horizontal, widescreen arrangements most home theater setups will have. Recorded shows are now displayed as a linear timeline with a graphic still, rather than plain text in a list.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Windows Vista Media Center, Music Library" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa09970c" height="480" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa09970c-pi.jpg" width="848">
</p>
<p>
Under Vista's Media Center, my 60+ GB music library is now a pleasure to navigate. Like videos, much better use of horizontal screen real estate; I can see dozens of albums at once. And the music library is <i>dramatically</i> faster. Displaying, searching, scrolling-- it's all nearly instantaneous now. I love the new "play all" shuffle mode, too.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Windows Vista Media Center, Guide" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa2e970c" height="480" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa2e970c-pi.jpg" width="848">
</p>
<p>
The program guide-- which is completely free, no monthly charges whatsoever-- now overlays the live video as a transparency. There's also a new popup Mini-Guide (not pictured) which lets you browse nearby channels without obscuring playback.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Windows Vista Media Center, Main Menu" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa58970c" height="480" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ffa58970c-pi.jpg" width="848">
</p>
<p>
The main menu no longer stops whatever I'm doing and zaps me back to a flat menu screen. It's more of a pop-up style menu, which can be accessed at any time through the big green MCE button. I can now continue watching my program in the background while navigating the main menu, too.
</p>
<p>
Another big quality of life improvement in Vista's Media Center is that <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000197.html">a DVD codec is included right out of the box</a>. So Vista's Media Center, unlike the one in Windows XP, is fully usable after a clean install. It even works with my SPDIF out for Dolby Digital sound playback. There's no longer any need to rely on questionable, expensive third-party DVD playback apps.
</p>
<p>
Did I mention burning TV shows to DVD is now included out of the box, too? As far as I'm concerned, <b>Media Center is the killer app for Vista</b>. And at $120 for the OEM Home Premium edition, it's a flat-out bargain for a better-than-Tivo experience-- without all those onerous monthly fees.
</p>
<p>
If you're interested in a home theater PC, all you need is the following:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Vista Home Premium (or Ultimate)
</li>
<li>relatively modern PC
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pcalchemy.com/index.php/cName/pvr-cardstv-tuners">MCE compatible PVR card</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pcalchemy.com/product_info.php/pName/microsoft-mce-remote-control-for-windows-xp-mce/cName/remote-controls">MCE remote</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
One caveat: I've stuck exclusively and intentionally with analog cable. All my digital video needs are satisified at the moment through DVD rentals and downloads. However, <b>it is possible to record and play back over the air HDTV signals with Media Center</b>, assuming you have a MCE compatible HDTV tuner installed (such as the <a href="http://www.pcalchemy.com/index.php/cName/hdtv-tuner-cards">AverMedia MCE A180</a>). The only unresolved issue at this point is <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/06/windows-vista-digital-cable-tuners-dont-call-it-ocur/">CableCard</a>, for digital cable.
