                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Seth Godin showed this slide during a recent <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294">presentation at Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Users don't care about YOU.</blockquote>
<p>What's the <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/biggest-web-design-mistakes-in-2004.html">biggest web design mistake of 2004?</a></p>
<blockquote> 1. Believing people care about you and your web site. </blockquote>
<p>Why isn't <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/002173.html">anyone reading our blog?</a></p>
<blockquote> 1. You're not a good-looking female who likes <a href="http://www.samugliestdog.com/pastwinners.html">posting naked pictures of herself</a>.<br> 2. There's nothing in it for them. </blockquote>
<p>This is not to say that <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/02/rethinking_test.html">users don't care</a>:</p>
<blockquote>The main point: <strong>users don't care about you as much as they care about themselves.</strong>
</blockquote>
<p>Users just <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/01/users_shouldnt_.html">aren't that into you</a>. It's not personal. It's business. Unless what you're writing …</p>
<ul>
<li>solves their problem </li>
<li>provides useful information </li>
<li>entertains them </li>
<li>makes them feel like <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/10/making_happy_us.html">they rule</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>…  it's irrational to expect users to care about it.</p>
<p>Every time you create something – whether it's a website, a client app, a blog post, a powerpoint presentation, or an email – ask yourself, "so what?" If you can't answer that question convincingly, reformulate and try again.</p>
