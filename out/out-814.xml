Joel Spolsky came up with a <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">twelve-item checklist</a> in August, 2000 that provides a rough measure of – in his words – "how good a software team is":</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you use source control?</li>
<li>
Can you make a build in one step?</li>
<li>
Do you make daily builds?</li>
<li>Do you have a bug database?</li>
<li>Do you fix bugs before writing new code?</li>
<li>Do you have an up-to-date schedule?</li>
<li>Do you have a spec?</li>
</ol>
Steve McConnell enumerated <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/bp08.htm">Software's Ten Essentials</a> in 1997, ten things that every software project should have:<p></p>
<ol>
<li>A product specification</li>
<li>A detailed user interface prototype</li>
<li>A realistic schedule</li>
<li>Explicit priorities</li>
<li>Active risk management</li>
<li>A quality assurance plan</li>
<li>Detailed activity lists</li>
<li>Software configuration management</li>
<li>Software architecture</li>
<li>An integration plan</li>
</ol>
<p>
These are great lists. <b>But Spolsky's list is 6 years old; McConnell's is almost 10 years old!</b> Does <i>your</i> software project meet all these criteria?
</p>
<p>
The lists are still highly relevant and definitely worth revisiting today. But I wonder if the field of software development has advanced far enough that we can take any of the items on this list for granted. I also wonder if any new practices have emerged in the last 6 years that aren't accounted for on either list.
</p>
<p>
So here's my question to you: <b>what core set of practices constitutes modern software development in 2006?</b>
</p>
