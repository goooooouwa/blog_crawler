One of the biggest highlights of PDC 2005 was the first day keynote, when the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/events/pdc/gallery.mspx">Office 12 UI was unveiled</a>. I don't know if people realized the significance of what we saw at the time-- but <b>we had just witnessed the death of the main menu</b>.

There's no "dropping down" in Office 12*; it's a context-sensitive tabbed palette interface.
</p>
<p>
<b>There is no main menu.</b>
</p>
<p>
That's huge. The main menu has been a cornerstone of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_%28computing%29">WIMP interface</a> since way back in the days of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lisa">Apple Lisa</a>. Julie Larson-Green, the PM of the office UI team, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/sep05/09-13OfficeUI.mspx">explains</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote><i>
The main part of the user experience is code-named the "ribbon." It's the one place you go to find the commands that are all about authoring Ã¢â‚¬â€œcreating the document, the presentation or the spreadsheet you're working on. There's no longer a stack of task panes and menus and toolbars to look through. There's just one place to look for commands.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
UI innovations in Office tend to be rapidly adopted by Microsoft across their entire product line. Not only there, but in third party applications and even other operating systems. <b>Remember the toolbar?</b> That was unknown until it debuted in Word in the early 90's**. Now it's ubiquitous. The "ribbon" is a similar paradigm shift. Eventually we'll all be using these tabbed palettes with nary a drop-down menu in sight. I expect the traditional WIMP main menu to go the way of the dodo soon after the release of Vista and Office 12 in 2006.
</p>
<p>
* with the apparent exception of the File drop-down, but even that doesn't look like a menu in the traditional sense when you click on it.
</p>
<p>
** The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2005/sep05/09-13OfficeUI.mspx">MS presspass article</a> states that this is "the most dramatic change to the way Office apps work since the introduction of the toolbar in 1997". <b>I think the toolbar goes back much further than that!</b> I just installed a copy of Microsoft Word 1.1a in a fresh Windows 3.1 VM image. Guess what? <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/microsoft_word_v1.png">
It has a toolbar</a>. So does <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/microsoft_word_v2.html">Word 2.0</a>.. and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/microsoft%20excel_v4.png">Excel 4.0</a>. I don't know what kind of crack those MS presspass guys are smoking..
