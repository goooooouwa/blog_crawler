<title>Level One: The Intro Stage</title>

                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Way back in 2007, before Stack Overflow was a glint in anyone's eye, I called software development a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/software-development-as-a-collaborative-game/">collaborative game</a>. And perhaps Stack Overflow was the natural outcome of that initial thought – recasting online software development discussion into a collaborative game where the only way to "win" is to learn from each other.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2014/10/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6821970b-pi.png" alt=""></p>
<p>That was <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-gamification/">before the word gamification existed</a>. But gamification is no longer the cool, hip concept it was back in 2011. Still, whether you call yourself a "gamer" or not, whether you believe in "gamification" or not, five years later <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-worlds-largest-mmorpg-youre-playing-it-right-now/">you're still playing the world's largest multiplayer game</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, you're playing it right now.</p>
<p>One of the most timeless aspects of games is how egalitarian they are, how easy it is for  anyone to get started. Men, women, children — people love games because everyone can play along. You don't have to take classes or go to college or be certified: <em>you just play</em>.  And this is, not so incidentally, how many of the programmers I know came to be programmers.</p>
<p>Do you know anyone that bought the video game Halo, or Myst, then proceeded to open the box and read the manual before playing the game? <em>Whoa there guys, we can't play the game yet, we gotta read these instructions first!</em> No, they stopped making manuals for games a long time ago, unless you count the thin sheet of paper that describes how to download / install the game on your device. Because they found out <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/2009/12/27/if-no-one-reads-the-manual-thats-okay/">nobody reads the manual</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project I’m working on is critical, but it has only about 3 to 4 users, most of whom are already familiar the application. One of the users even drives the design. The manual I’m writing, which is nearly 200 pages, is mostly a safety measure for business continuity planning. I don’t expect anyone will ever read it.</p>
<p>It’s a project I managed to procrastinate for months, working on other projects, even outside the scope of my regular assignments. The main deterrent, I believe, was my perception that no one needed the manual. The users seemed to be getting along fine without it.</p>
<p>And so as the year ticked to a close, instead of learning more about Mediawiki and screencasting and After Effects, I spent my time updating a 200-page manual that I don’t think anyone will ever read. It will be printed out, three-hole punched, and placed in a binder to collect dust on a shelf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess that's not surprising for games. Games are supposed to be fun, and reading manuals isn't fun; it's pretty much the opposite of fun. But it is also true for software in general. Reading manuals isn't <em>work</em>, at least, it isn't whatever specific thing you set out to do when you fired up that bit of software on your phone, tablet, or laptop.</p>
<p>Games have another clever trick up their sleeve, though. Have you ever noticed that in most of today's games, the first level is kind of easy. Like… <em>suspiciously</em> easy?</p>
<p>That's because level one, the intro stage, isn't really part of the game. <strong>It's the manual.</strong></p>

<p>As MegaMan X illustrates, manuals are pointless when we can learn about the game in the best and most natural way imaginable: by <em>playing the actual game</em>. You learn by doing, provided you have a well designed sandbox that lets you safely experiment as you're starting out in the game.</p>
<p>(The above video does contain some slightly NSFW language, as well as abuse of cartoon female avatars that I don't endorse, but it is utterly brilliant, applies to every app, software and website anyone has ever built, and I strongly recommend watching it all.)</p>
<p>This same philosophy applies to today's software and websites. Don't bother with all the manuals, video introductions, tutorials, and pop-up help dialogs. Nobody's going to read that stuff, at least, not the people who need it.</p>
<p>Instead, follow the lesson of MegaMan: if you want to teach people about your software, consider how you can <strong>build a great intro stage</strong> and let them start playing with it immediately.</p>
