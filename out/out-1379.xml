With all this talk of high-falutin' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/codihorr-20">coding design patterns</a>, I'm surprised we haven't seen more sites that cover <b>GUI design patterns</b>, like <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/gui/index.html">welie.com</a>*. What a great site!
</p>
<p>
Consider the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=1&amp;q=http://www.apple.com/ipod/&amp;e=7620">iPod</a>: it's a 2.5" hard drive, strapped to a battery and a LCD, that plays MP3 files. Dozens of other taiwanese manufacturers make products exactly like this, but Apple is the only company <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3895363.stm">making a fortune at it</a>, and inspiring <a href="http://www.techreport.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=19813">fanatical product loyalty</a>. Why? It has the most usable interface.
</p>
<p>
The mechanical things (coding patterns) are actually quite easy. It's the soft GUI stuff that is difficult, and that's ultimately what makes your product sexy, desirable-- and a success. We may think coding patterns are sexy, but they're invisible to users.
