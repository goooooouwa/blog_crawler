It's easy to fire off an email with barely any effort at all. And that's exactly how much effort goes into most emails: none. Ole Eichhorn's <a href="http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030308-tyranny_of_email.html">Tyranny of Email</a> offers a succinct set of guidelines to avoid thoughtless email abuse:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Never criticize anyone in email. Avoid technical debates.  Use face-to-face meetings or phone calls instead.
</li>
<li>Be judicious in who you send email to, and who you copy on emails.
</li>
<li>Observing some formality is important.
</li>
<li>Don't hesitate to review and revise important emails.
</li>
<li>Remember that email is a public and permanent record.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ole published another article, <a href="http://www.w-uh.com/articles/030316-tyranny_revisited.html">Tyranny Revisited</a>, with some commentary on the response to his original article.

43 folders recently published a great article on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/09/writing_sensibl.html">writing sensible email messages</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Understand why you're writing: what's the goal?
</li>
<li>Assume no one will read more than the first two sentences of your email.
</li>
<li>Write a great subject line.
</li>
<li>Fit it on one screen with no scrolling.
</li>
<li>Ask for what you want.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
Similar rules apply to instant messaging, telephone, and even face-to-face conversations. The key difference is the amount of effort required for each communication method: the easier it is, the more you need to consider before doing it.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the real art is knowing when to escalate from IM to email, from email to face-to-face, and when to drop the ultimate communication A-bomb: <b>calling a meeting</b>.
