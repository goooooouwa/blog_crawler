<title>Pick a License, Any License</title>

                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I hate software licenses. When I read a software license, what I see is a bunch of officious, mind-numbing lawyerly doublespeak. Blah, blah,   blah.. <em>kill me now.</em></p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d7d8f970b" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d7d8f970b-pi.jpg" border="0" alt="meaningless license certificate" width="407" height="580"></p>
<p>If I had my way, everything would be released under the <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">WTFPL</a>. Over time, I've begrudgingly come to the conclusion   that, like lawyers, death, and taxes, choosing a software license is inevitable.     Of course, it doesn't matter if yours are the only human eyes that   will ever see the code. But <strong>a proper software license is a necessary evil for any code you plan to release to the public</strong>.</p>
<p>I definitely regret not choosing a software license for my CodeProject articles. I'll occasionally get friendly emails from people asking   permission to use the code from my articles in various projects, commercial and otherwise. It's thoughtful of people to ask first. I do appreciate it, and permission is   always granted with the single caveat that my name and URL remain in the comments.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">Because I did not explicitly indicate a license, I declared an implicit copyright without explaining how others could use my code.</span> Since the code is unlicensed, I could theoretically assert copyright at any time and demand that people stop using my code. Experienced developers won't touch unlicensed code because <em>they have no legal right to use it</em>. That's ironic, considering the whole reason I posted the code in the first place was so other developers could benefit from that code.  I could have easily avoided this unfortunate situation if I had done the right thing and <strong>included a software license with my code</strong>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we love software licenses like we love standards – that's why <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">there are so many of them</a>. And what, exactly, are the differences between all these licenses? How do you select the correct license for your software? I've attempted to succinctly capture the key differences between the most well-known software licenses in the following handy chart.</p>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="3" width="720px" style="">

<td width="100" valign="top" style="border-bottom:dotted 1px black"></td>

<td valign="top">
<span style="color: red;">None</span> (0)</td>
<td valign="top">Without a license, the code is copyrighted by default. People can read the code, but they have no legal right to use it. To use the code, you must contact the author directly and ask permission.</td>

<td valign="top">Open</td>
<td valign="top">Permissive (0)</td>
<td valign="top">If your code is in the   public domain, anyone may use your code for any purpose whatsoever. Nothing is in the public domain by default; you have to explicitly put your   work in the public domain if you want it there.

</table>
<p>After compiling this table, I've learned two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>My head hurts.</li>
<li>I still prefer the <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/">WTFPL</a>. </li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not even going to get into the many <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000247.html">religious issues</a> of software   licensing, such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source software</a> vs.             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft licensing</a> vs. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_license">permissive licensing</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoisation">Tivoization</a> in hardware</li>
<li>the   pernicious issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent">software patents</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>It's a minefield, people. All I'm saying is this: <strong>the next time you release code into the wild, do your fellow developers a favor and pick a license – any license</strong>.</p>
