<a href="http://www.nedbatchelder.com/blog/200701.html#e20070108T073027">Ned</a> recently pointed out Martin Fowler's article <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren't Stubs</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
The vocabulary for talking about [pretend objects] soon gets messy - all sorts of words are used: stub, mock, fake, dummy. For this article I'm going to follow the vocabulary of <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/">Gerard Meszaros's upcoming book</a>. It's not what everyone uses, but I think it's a good vocabulary and since it's my essay I get to pick which words to use. Meszaros uses the term <b>Test Double as the generic term for any kind of pretend object used in place of a real object for testing purposes</b>.
</blockquote>
<p>
Personally, I like to think of them as <i>Stunt Objects</i>. Meszaros, via Fowler, defines the following taxonomy of pretend objects:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<b>Dummy objects</b> are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="fake.jpg" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe8f6970c" height="172" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/01/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe8f6970c-pi.jpg" width="290">
</p>
<p>
<b>Fake objects</b> actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="stubs.jpg" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe91d970c" height="199" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/01/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe91d970c-pi.jpg" width="302">
</p>
<p>
<b>Stub objects</b> provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="mock.jpg" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe93c970c" height="216" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2007/01/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776fe93c970c-pi.jpg" width="219">
</p>
<p>
<b>Mock objects</b> are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
