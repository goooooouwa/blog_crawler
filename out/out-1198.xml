An eagle-eyed CodeProject reader posted a comment to my <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000094.html">ASP.NET CAPTCHA Server Control</a> article pointing out one French developer's very thorough <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/projects/pwntcha/%0A">attempts to defeat many common CAPTCHA techniques</a>. He compares lots of visual CAPTCHAs side by side and comments on their strengths and weaknesses. Some of the "best" CAPTCHAs have this comment attached to them: <i>not always human-solvable.</i> Heh.

His main point seems to be that CAPTCHAs hurt accessibility, and that's totally valid:
