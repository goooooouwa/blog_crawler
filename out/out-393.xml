<p>Hi there. I want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZf4agDIgiQ">talk to you about ducts</a>.*</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pZf4agDIgiQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Sorry, when I said ducts, I meant <b>mousepads</b>.</p>
<p>As I have a <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/my-mouse-fetish/">long-standing</a> <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/mouse-dpi-and-usb-polling-rate/">mouse</a> <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/mouse-ballistics/">fetish</a>, you might not be surprised to learn that I also fetishize the humble mousepad, as well. It's all perfectly healthy. Really.</p>
<p>Let's start with the obvious: <b>do you even need a mousepad?</b> It's a fair question. Are you using a traditional mouse? Maybe you're using a trackball, trackpad, trackpoint, or something else with the word "track" in it. If so, then thanks for reading this far. Come back for my next post.</p>
<p>For the rest of us using standard computer mice, consider the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your mousing surface uneven?
</li>
<li>Does your mousing surface have an inconsistent texture?
</li>
<li>Does your mousing surface interfere with the optical LED or laser sensors in modern mice?
</li>
<li>Are you concerned that your present mousing surface will be damaged or marred from extended mousing?
</li>
<li>Do you struggle to find enough room to move your mouse?
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, <b>you should probably have a mousepad</b>. The average desktop often does not provide a consistent mousing surface; a well-designed mousepad does. That is its purpose – to stake out a consistent, reliable, and durable mousing surface on your desktop.</p>
<p>Believe me, I'd love to be a minimalist and go without any kind of mousepad, but I always end up needing one. I started wearing a <i>permanent</i> mark in <a href="http://adam.pra.to/jerker/">my beloved Ikea Jerker desk</a> with my mousing here at home, for example. I've also found that extended mousing leaves behind an unpleasant-but-cleanable residue, and I'd rather clean the mousepad than my desk.</p>
<p>Now that we've established the need for a mousing surface, it's time to decide exactly what you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>a wrist rest?
</li>
<li>raised and thick or low-profile and thin?
</li>
<li>smooth or textured?
</li>
<li>metal, glass, cloth, or plastic?
</li>
<li>small, medium, large, or <i>obscenely</i> large in size?
</li>
<li>square, rectangular, circular, or some other shape?
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's <i>before</i> we get into issues of color and style. If you consider the above questions, you can narrow it down substantially. I do have two general recommendations, however.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036WTBFY/codihorr-20">Razer Vespula</a>. If you're OK with a relatively large mousepad, this 10.2" x 12.6" model is one of my favorites. It's built on a low-profile hard plastic base to resist bending, with soft rubber feet on all sides, as well as a thin rubber mat you can place underneath so there's no slippage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036WTBFY/codihorr-20"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/07/razer-vespula.jpg" alt="Razer Vespula"></a></p>
<p>It's also reversible: one side is "speed" (smooth), the other "control" (textured). And it bundles an optional wrist rest sized to nestle perfectly against the bottom of the pad.</p>
<p>I bought my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0036WTBFY/codihorr-20">Vespula</a> way back in 2011 and it's still going strong. Many years later, I believe <strong>the general idea of a reversible, double sided mousepad with a thin metal or hard plastic core is close to the best of all worlds</strong>. With that in mind, I can also recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00BF9MZZI/codihorr-20">Corsair MM600</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00OP4GBP0/codihorr-20">Perixx DX-5000XL</a>. They are all big, though. Imagine an iPad or something a bit larger sitting next to your keyboard.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something more basic, I can also recommend XTrac, specifically <a href="http://pcxmods.com/plastic-surface-mousepads/">their hard surface mousepads</a>. They're very thin, rubber backed, and come in a variety of sizes. At one point I had it literally glued to my desk with removable spray adhesive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.xtracgear.com/mouse-pads/"><img alt="xtrac mousepads" height="451" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2008/04/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128777041e2970c-pi.jpg" width="652"></a></p>
<p>They're all thin, but the <a href="http://pcxmods.com/desktop-skins/">Logic "skin" models</a> are super thin. Extreme thinness can make the XTrac a natural extension of your desk.</p>
<p><a href="http://pcxmods.com/plastic-surface-mousepads/"><img src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2015/07/xtrac-thinness.jpg" alt="XTrac mouse surface thickness comparison"></a></p>
<p>I don't recommend the cloth / fabric branch of the XTrac family tree – or any mousing surface, for that matter.</p>
<p>I am not proposing either of the above as the final mousing surface solution, but I have used both extensively. There are plenty of other great choices; I've heard people say very nice things about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=WOW!PAD&amp;tag=codihorr-20&amp;index=blended&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">the unusual circular WOW!PAD</a>, for example.</p>
<p>I could also talk about <a href="http://pcxmods.com/products/xtracgear-mad-wax.html">how I regularly lubricate my mice feet and mousepads</a>, but then I'd worry that people might think I've gone too far with my mouse fetish.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>
<p>It's my hope that after reading this, <b>you'll be able to tell a well-designed, quality mousing surface</b> from those cheap, floppy, disintegrating fabric <i>things</i> that are mousepads in name only.</p>
