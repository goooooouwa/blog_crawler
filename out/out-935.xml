Black and white works fine when I'm reading newspapers. But when I'm reading computer languages of any kind-- from Perl to SQL, from C# to Regular Expressions, from HTML to XML -- <b>I can't bear to read them in black and white any more.</b>
</p>
<p>
Consider this <a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=f8375d1c-d355-486f-bb15-de9bee369fc0">Infocard XML</a> as you'd see it in a basic Notepad style text editor, perhaps with a little line numbering:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Infocard XML" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d616b970b" height="513" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d616b970b-pi.png" width="529">
</p>
<p>
It's just a <b>slew of angle bracket noise that makes my brain hurt</b>. But if view the same file in an editor that can colorize the XML..
</p>
<p>
<img alt="Colorized Infocard XML" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6183970b" height="513" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6183970b-pi.png" width="529">
</p>
<p>
.. all of a sudden we can clearly see what's going on.
</p>
<p>
Plain old Notepad is perfectly adequate for reading text files. But if you're reading code or markup of any kind, Notepad doesn't work very well. <b>We need colorization to truly understand what we're looking at.</b>
</p>
<p>
Why is that? Are we just spoiled?
</p>
