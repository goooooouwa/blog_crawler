<title>Stack Overflow Careers: Amplifying Your Awesome</title>

<content>
                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>
That <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001101.html">Stack Overflow thing we launched a year ago</a>? It's been <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/08/us-versus-hyphen/">going pretty well</a> so far.
</p>
<p>
Of course, everyone knows you could code Stack Overflow in a long weekend. <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001284.html">It's trivial</a>. Assembling a worldwide community of smart, engaged software developers? <i>That's</i> a whole different ball of wax. Stack Overflow is a site by programmers, for programmers; it's only as good as the programmers who <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2008/11/stack-overflow-is-you/">choose to participate</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
Stack Overflow isn't about me. Or anybody else on the Stack Overflow team for that matter.
<p>
<b>Stack Overflow is <i>you</i>.</b>
</p>
<p>
This is the scary part, the great leap of faith that Stack Overflow is predicated on: trusting your fellow programmers. The programmers who choose to participate in Stack Overflow are the "secret sauce" that makes it work. You are the reason I continue to believe in developer community as the greatest source of learning and growth. You are the reason I continue to get so many positive emails and testimonials about Stack Overflow. I can't take credit for that. But you can.
</p>
<p>
I learned the collective power of my fellow programmers long ago writing on Coding Horror. The community is far, far smarter than I will ever be. All I can ask â€“ all any of us can ask â€“ is to help each other along the path.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I am continually humbled by the skill and expertise of the programmers who volunteer time to Stack Overflow. These programmers graciously donate tiny slivers of their day to help us -- and themselves -- become better programmers. These 5 and 10 minute slices of effort, across hundreds of thousands of questions and answers, become a permanently archived (and <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/06/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">creative commons wiki licensed</a>) bread crumb content trail for future programmers to follow, edit, and contribute to themselves over time.
</p>
<p>
I'm thrilled to see Stack Overflow working so well for both askers and answerers; the "pay it forward" model of programmers helping their peers is <i>exactly</i> what we were shooting for. We'll never change the world, but it sure is nice to be able to improve our small corner of it just a little bit. Remember: bad code that isn't written, is bad code that another poor programmer won't have to debug. If we don't reach out to <s>slap</s>help new programmers and teach them the lessons we learned the hard way, who will? I'm only exaggerating a little when I say that <i>the future of our entire profession depends on it.</i>
</p>
<p>
If you're actively participating on Stack Overflow, we now have another way to convert those slices of effort into something that actively furthers your professional goals â€“ <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Careers</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/"><img alt="Stack Overflow Careers" border="0" height="64" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/11/logo.png" width="363"></a>
</p>
<p>
What is <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">careers.stackoverflow.com</a>? It's a few things:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>a <b>completely free, public CV hosting service for programmers</b>, to share the cool stuff you've coded and created with the world.
</li>
<li>a way to explicitly <b>link your Stack Overflow profile</b> with your CV, to provide concrete examples of your communication skills and individual expertise to anyone who is interested.
</li>
<li>a better way to <b>connect great programmers with the best programming jobs</b>, for those who opt into the small annual listing fee.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In short, Stack Overflow Careers <b>amplifies your awesome</b>.
</p>
<p>
I won't lie to you. This is also a business. That's why there are nominal opt-in listing fees for those programmers interested in seeking employment, and <i>substantial</i> fees for hiring managers who want to tap into the smart developers who grok Stack Overflow.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red">update:</font> I apologize if I wasn't clear. It is 100% free, forever, to create a public CV, put whatever HTML content you want in it, and link it to your Stack Overflow profile. Like so:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/klmr">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/klmr</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jongalloway">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jongalloway</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/brandan">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/brandan</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/brentkeller">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/brentkeller</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mfoord">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/mfoord</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These are of course freely indexable and searchable on the web.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the free public component, there is a private (and completely optional) subscription component. For those programmers actively seeking employment, a small annual subscription fee allows inclusion in a private employer search UI. This is also explained in the <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/faq">faq</a> and <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/about">about</a>.
</p>
<p>
That said, we're also trying to do something a bit different here. Something better than the endless, mind-numbing acronym sea of monster.com, dice.com, et al. Joel and I believe <b>current hiring practices for programmers are incredibly broken</b>. We think we can do better.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dilbert.com"><img alt="dilbert-interview.png" border="0" class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86e2e94970b" height="205" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2009/11/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86e2e94970b-pi.png" width="600"></a>
</p>
<p>
We love our work, and so should you. Our goal isn't to put warm bodies in front of interviewers. <b>Our goal is to create love connections.</b> Instead of avid programmers pursuing disinterested and distracted companies, it's the other way around -- savvy companies who understand the competitive advantages of having the best programmers will pursue <i>you</i>. We connect smart, engaged hiring managers who "get it" with top programmers who love to code.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
If you love to code, too, I encourage you to <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/">create your own Stack Overflow CV</a>. Keep it private, or make it public via the URL of your choice -- it's completely free either way. If you think you might be actively looking for a job in the next 3 years, take advantage of <b>our <i>outrageously</i> low promotional pricing of $29 for a 3 year filing</b>. That way, at any point in those 3 years, you can flip a switch and become visible to hiring managers. Or not. It's totally up to you.
</p>
<p>
(also, if you're hiring, and your company appreciates top software engineers -- and you think you can convince our tough audience of that -- <a href="mailto:careers@stackoverflow.com">email us</a>)
