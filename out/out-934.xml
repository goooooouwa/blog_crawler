<title>Choosing between .NET Pepsi and .NET Coke</title>

                <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>I've increasingly come to believe that the debate between C# and VB.NET is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red herring</a>. Choosing between C# and VB.NET isn't a <em>meaningful</em> choice. <strong>It's like choosing between .NET Pepsi and .NET Coke</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d602e970b" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d602e970b-pi.jpg" alt="Pepsi vs. Coke" width="378" height="240"></p>
<p>Either way, <em>you're getting a cola flavored carbonated beverage</em>.</p>
<p>If C# is Coke and VB.NET is Pepsi, then Python is <a href="http://www.drinkyoo-hoo.com/about/history.html">Yoohoo</a>. It's more than mild differences in syntax. It's a completely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_language">dynamic language</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck typing</a> where <a href="http://www.secnetix.de/~olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk">indentation is used in place of squigglies or End statements</a>.</p>
<p>Wasn't this the promise of the .NET runtime-- that we'd have <strong>real, meaningful choice of language?</strong> That's why I'm so excited about <a href="http://www.ironpython.com/">IronPython</a>. IronPython has been a fine <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">proof of concept</a>, but it had no IDE integration. Until now.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronmar/archive/2006/02/16/533273.aspx">documented</a> in Aaron Marten's blog, the latest CTP of the <a href="http://affiliate.vsipmembers.com/affiliate/downloadfiles.aspx">Visual Studio SDK</a> finally <strong>makes Python a first-class citizen in the Visual Studio 2005 IDE:</strong></p>

<p>And here's the requisite <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000517.html">Hello World</a> example:</p>
<p><img class="at-xid-6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6045970b" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/uploads/2006/02/6a0120a85dcdae970b0120a86d6045970b-pi.png" alt="Visual Studio 2005 Python 'Hello World' Project" width="596" height="385"></p>
<p>I can't see any obvious way to build a web or winforms app in Python yet. But it's coming.</p>
