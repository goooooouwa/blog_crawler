The <a href="http://www.emuunlim.com/doteaters/play2sta2.htm">first video game to introduce a high score table was Asteroids</a>, and after that they were a key fixture in virtually every arcade game from the 80's and 90's. One of my favorite high score tables was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaplus">Gaplus</a>, the little known sequel to the mega-popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a>, which was itself the sequel to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxian">Galaxian</a>.

I thought <b>the inclusion of blood type in the high score table for Gaplus was a clever commentary on the meaninglessness of high score tables</b> by the game's developers. As it turns out, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.video.arcade.collecting/msg/e208666c62f099ea?dmode=source">it's just a Japanese eccentricity</a>:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>
If this is a Japanese game, this would make some sense. In Japan, blood type is matched with personality, much like horoscopes here in the US. It's not uncommon to see blood type given for different characters in a game or comic, along with sex, age, etc. It's an important vital statistic that gives more insight to a person!

<p>
We may not play arcade games any more, but <b>we still have our high score tables</b>.
