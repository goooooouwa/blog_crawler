What would the world be like <strong>if Windows 95 and Windows NT has been cancelled?</strong> You'd be surfing the web right now in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.x">Windows for Workgroups 3.11</a>:

I absolutely love the fact that <strong>we get a javascript error on the Google homepage</strong>. Not unreasonable, considering WFW 3.11 was well on its way to total obsolescence before Google even made it out of a Stanford dorm room <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000305.html">in 1998</a>.
</p>
<p>
I never browsed the intarweb through any version of Windows 3.x. Most people are surprised to find that there was a Windows 3.x version of circa-1999 Internet Explorer 5. By the time the web caught on in late '95, most of the early adopters I knew had already transitioned to Windows 95. I distinctly remember using the first version of IE under Windows 95-- the one that didn't understand the &lt;table&gt; tag or animated gifs!

As for the title of this post, according to <a href="http://bink.nu/Codenames.bink">the canonical list of Microsoft code names</a>, <strong>Snowball</strong> was the internal Microsoft codename for the WFW 3.11 project. If you want to rock your own WFW 3.11 virtual machine, you can <a href="http://www.peteweb.com/index.php?showtopic=3987">download the OS from peteweb</a>. And don't forget DOS 6.22 like I did! Set it up following the great instructions from Virtual PC guy:

<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2004/10/28/248940.aspx">Networking Windows 3.11</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's a huge collection of old 16-bit Windows software on the <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/win3x/download.htm">10 year anniversary of Windows 3.1 page</a>. It's a sketchy looking website, but if you follow the yahoo briefcase download instructions closely, the software is all still present and downloadable.

<p>
You may find <a href="http://www.winimage.com/winimage.htm">WinImage</a> helpful here for creating floppy disk images from collections of files. Virtual PC only understands non-compressed (.IMA) floppy images, so be sure you avoid the default compressed (.IMZ) floppy images.
