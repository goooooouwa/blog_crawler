<b>Seriously. Enough with this already.</b> I'm gonna hurt somebody.

If you're not in on the joke, it's an artifact of Microsoft's <a href="http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry">Windows Live Writer</a> blogging tool. It generates "hidden" skeleton blog posts to detect CSS styles in its editor, but these posts somehow keep showing up in my aggregator. And <i>that's annoying</i>.
</p>
<p>
There are also <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22temporary+post+used+for+style+detection%22">19,500 google results for the phrase "temporary post used for style detection"</a>. Gee, thanks, Windows Live Writer. That's exactly 19,499 too many. <a href="http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/08/microsoft-wysiwyg-blog-editor-how-do-i.html">This post is actually useful</a>, since it describes the problem in more detail.
</p>
<p>
On the plus side, I did get the chance to bring two new GUIDs into the world. And <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000399.html">you know how I love GUIDs</a>.
